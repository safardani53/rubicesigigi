He is the second eldest son of Angelica Yulo and Mark Andrew Yulo.</p><p>In his family, he has his elder brother,<span class="LrzXr kno-fv"> Joriel Yulo, followed by his younger brother and sister, </span><span class="LrzXr kno-fv">Karl Jahrel Eldrew Yulo and Iza Yulo.</span></p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Carlos-With-His-Parents-In-Press-Conference.jpg></p><p>Born in Manila, Yulo was raised in Leveriza Street, Malate, near the Rizal Memorial Stadium. Thus, most of his childhood was spent watching the Philippines’ top gymnasts training.</p><p>Hence, we can say he had exposure to the field from a tender age and started when he was seven.</p><h3>Education</h3><p>First, Yulo was enrolled in the Aurora A. Quezon Elementary School in Malina, where he completed his primary education.</p><p>Alongside, he commenced his gymnastics training at the Philippine National Games.</p><p>During his tenure, he stood as a member of the National Capital Region’s gymnastics team.</p><p>He got free training during his tenure and also got the chance to attend Adamson University in Ermita.</p><p>Thanks to the Gymnastics Association of the Philippines, he accomplished his secondary education from Adamson University.</p><p>Following it, he had to move to Japan, where he started his further education at Teikyo University in Itabashi.</p><p>Currently, Yulo is fluent in Japanese and studies under a scholarship program provided by the Japan Olympic Association.</p><p>Not to mention, he commenced his study in 2013 and is devoted to a degree in literature.</p><h2>Carlos Yulo | Amateur Career</h2><p>Yulo commenced early with his work at the age of seven. It all started the day when his grandfather Rodrigo Frisco saw him doing somersaults in the playground.</p><p>Before it, he used to do acrobatics with his friends in the Paraiso ng Batang Maynila, a playground and park near the Manila Zoo.</p><p>In addition to that, his grandfather admitted Yulo to the Gymnastics Association of the Philippines (GAP). Following it, he was also provided free training by Philippine Sports Commission at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Carlos-Edriel-Yulo-performing-Source-Panay-News.jpg></p><p>Likewise, he commenced his game participation in 2008 as a part of the National Capital Region’s gymnastics team.</p><p>However, during his first years, he didn’t win any titles until 2011. The years of practice were fruiting in 2011 when he claimed four gold medals alone in the 2011 Palarong Pambansa.</p><p>At the same time, he also gained gold in the 2011 Philippine National Games.</p><p>Meanwhile, Japan sent coach Munehiro Kugimiya to train Filipino gymnasts as a friendly gesture. He was quite impressed with Yulo and believed in his skills back then.</p><p>Therefore, Kugimiya offered him a chance to train in Japan; however, Yulo was sixteen.</p><p>Innocently, he replied to ask his parents first. Later, he moved to Japan with his parent’s consent and commenced his training.</p><p>As always, the training didn’t come up easily, and Yulo didn’t give up.</p><p>Similarly, Yulo garnered the limelight the next year after claiming gold for the parallel bars at the 14th Junior Asian Championships in Bangkok, Thailand.</p><p>“My mother told me it was better to go to Japan and train with coach Munehiro, so I went. I was a shy kid then, and there was a problem with communication. It was a bit hard since I was alone.”<br>-Carlos Yulo</p><p><strong>Know About More Gymnasts <a href=# rel=noopener>12 Best Gymnasts In The World Right Now>></a></strong></p><h2>Carlos Yulo | Professional Career</h2><p>At the age of 18, Carlos Yulo entered the senior league games through the 2018 Gymnastics World Cup series.</p><p>He was liked for his Melbourne, Baku, Doha, and Cottbus events during his tenure.

Therefore, Yulo’s coach passed the message by phone to his parents.</p><p>Following it, Yulo had a phone call to his parents where he mentioned he wanted to cry but couldn’t as he was too shy.</p><p>Altogether, the victory was celebrated by his whole nation as he stood aloof as a historic feat.</p><p>“We weren’t able to watch the live streaming on YouTube because we really did not expect Caloy to win.
