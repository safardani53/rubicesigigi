Both of these vacuum styles are powerful enough to pick up all types of dirt and debris from your floors and carpeting, but there are several reasons why a canister vacuum may be the superior choice for your home.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Canister vacuums typically have more suction power than an upright vacuum, and they are also usually quieter,” explains Jessica Samson, cleaning expert at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">The Maids</a>. “They also tend to be much lighter, and the wand is more maneuverable and can be helpful for reaching hard-to-reach places.” Canister vacuums come in both bagged and bagless models, and there are a wide range of sizes — and price points — to choose from, so you can find an option that’s well-suited to your needs.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To help you find the canister vacuum that’s right for you, we tested 16 of today’s most popular models, evaluating them on suction power, noise level, maneuverability, and more.

This canister vacuum is on the smaller side, weighing less than 10 pounds, and we found that it was easy to pull around as we cleaned — the wheels rolled smoothly in any direction, even when the vacuum was on carpeting. We had no problem maneuvering the vacuum around obstacles, and its lightweight form makes it easy to carry up stairs when needed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Kenmore vacuum didn’t disappoint when it came to suction power, either. If you're looking for a great <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>vacuum for pet hair</a>, this model quickly picked that up -- as well as debris like sand, dust, and raw pasta, and it performed equally well on carpeting and hard surfaces. The upholstery tool was also very effective, quickly pulling hair and lint off sofa cushions. However, long hair strands can get wrapped around the vacuum’s brush roll, and we found it challenging to clean off, as the brush itself can’t be removed from the floor attachment.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you’re done cleaning, it’s easy to empty the vacuum’s bagless dust bin, and it can be rinsed out with water for a more thorough clean. The vacuum has a HEPA filter system that keeps dust and allergens out of your home, and it also comes with a dusting brush, crevice tool, and bare floor tool, allowing you to clean any surface throughout your home. Our only other criticism is that the power cord is quite short — just 16 feet — which limits how far you can clean before needing to find a new outlet.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $121.25 (orig. $149.99)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bagless | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 11.4 x 12.2 x 28.8 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 9.5 pounds | <strong>Capacity:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Hose Length:</strong> 9 feet | <strong>Cord Length: </strong>16 feet | <strong>Attachments:</strong> Dusting brush, crevice tool, bare floor tool, pet turbine brush</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-blackdecker-bagless-multi-cyclone-canister-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Black+Decker Bagless Canister Vacuum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BLACK+DECKER Bagless Multi-Cyclone Canister Vacuum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/x7FZlT3vTB99CpI6YeX0GldBr6I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/black-decker-bagless-multi-cyclone-canister-vacuum-0689897ab0494a24a734d79cc72046e2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Emptying</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Noise Level</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=-1><p>This vacuum efficiently picks up small debris from carpeting and hard floors.</p></li><li readability=0><p>It’s quiet enough to talk over while vacuuming, even on the highest setting.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=1><p>Taller people will have to bend over to push the wand, which is uncomfortable for longer cleaning sessions.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Large, heavy debris like pasta often falls out of the vacuum.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Canister vacuums can be quite pricey, but this model from Black+Decker is a budget-friendly choice, retailing for less than $125. Despite its reasonable price point, this canister vacuum is still quite a powerhouse — it had no problem picking up dust, dirt, and pet hair from both carpeting and hard floors in our testing. (Though, it did struggle a bit when vacuuming on tile floors.) Plus, we love that the vacuum operates so quietly, and we were able to hold a conversation while cleaning, even when the vacuum was on its highest setting.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This vacuum has two oversized wheels that allow it to roll around behind you when cleaning, but we didn’t have to move it as much as other models thanks to its extra-long hose and wand. It also has a large 3-liter bagless dust bin that’s easy to empty, as well as a HEPA filter for allergen control. However, there are a few downsides to this budget-friendly model: Taller people may find the vacuum to be uncomfortable to use, as you do have to hunch over to push the wand around the floor. Additionally, the vacuum isn't the best on larger pieces of debris — during testing, pieces of orzo pasta tended to fall back out of the nozzle after we turned the vacuum off.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $122.20</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bagless | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 14 x 10.47 x 16 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 21.1 pounds | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 3 liters | <strong>Hose Length:</strong> 5 feet | <strong>Cord Length:</strong> 19.5 feet | <strong>Attachments:</strong> Crevice tool, dusting brush, upholstery tool</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-miele-sban0-classic-c1-pure-suction-powerline-canister-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Miele SBAN0 Classic C1 Pure Suction PowerLine</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Miele Classic C1 Pure Suction Bagged Canister Vacuum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/3lGOxuB0nOTRAZjVH7IZKOtAZ38=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/miele-classic-c1-pure-suction-bagged-canister-vacuum-3977f35ebc2345d783833d6486d57cc6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Emptying</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Noise Level</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>Powerful suction picks up debris on hard floors in just one or two passes.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Thanks to the design of the floorhead, pet hair doesn’t get tangled up in the rollers.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The indicator light lets you know when the bag is full.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you don’t mind spending a little more on a vacuum that will last for years, the Miele Classic C1 Pure Suction is a worthwhile investment for your home. Miele is known for its powerful canister vacuums, but we were still blown away by just how much suction power this model delivered. It needed just one or two passes to pick up all the debris off the floor during testing, and it worked particularly well on hard floors, leaving them looking spotless. The vacuum has six suction settings and a combination floorhead that can be switched between hard floors and carpeting, but we did find that it’s hard to push across rugs, as the suction creates quite a bit of resistance.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This canister vacuum collects all the dust and debris inside a 4.5-liter bag, and we like that there’s an indicator light to let you know when the bag is full. The canister sits on three wheels that make for easy maneuvering, and the vacuum is impressively quiet on its lowest setting, making it possible to clean without disturbing other people in your household. The Miele C1 comes with three small accessories that clip onto the base of its hose, and overall, it’s a powerful cleaning tool that’s especially great for homes with lots of hard floors.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $349</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bagged | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 18.2 x 11 x 8.7 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 12 pounds | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 4.5 liters | <strong>Hose Length:</strong> 5.5 feet | <strong>Cord Length:</strong> 18 feet | <strong>Attachments:</strong> Upholstery nozzle, crevice nozzle, dusting brush</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-design-bissell-smartclean-canister-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Design</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bissell SmartClean Canister Vacuum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Bissell SmartClean Canister Vacuum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/xB5FpSmUEFy619j55-IGKK_l9zc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bissell-smartclean-canister-vacuum-3c9c405c8f324df8a5f883db78992d00.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Emptying</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Noise Level</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Edge-cleaning bristles capture dirt from along the walls.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Its integrated dust brush is convenient to use.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>A long power cord provides an extra-large operating radius.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Bissell SmartClean Canister Vacuum is another worthwhile option for your home, and we particularly liked its thoughtful design features, including edge-cleaning bristles and an integrated dust brush. The vacuum’s floorhead has extra bristles on the sides, and in testing, they were great for capturing dirt and dust along the edges of walls. Additionally, the vacuum has a dust brush built into its handle, so it’s always on hand and ready to use when you need to dust off baseboards or window blinds.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The SmartClean vacuum has three suction settings, and it transitions well from hard floors to carpeting. It was able to pick up the majority of debris in just two or three passes, but it did struggle a bit with pet hair, so it might not be the best choice for households with furry friends. In addition to its powerful suction, we liked that this vacuum has a long 30-foot power cord with a retractable design, which allowed us to clean more surface area without having to stop and find a new outlet. We did have a little trouble opening the dust bin at first, but it shouldn’t be an issue once you know how to do it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish</strong>:<strong> $200.61 (orig. $257.49)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bagless | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 12 x 19 x 50 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 18.1 pounds | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 2 liters | <strong>Hose Length:</strong> 6.6 feet | <strong>Cord Length:</strong> 30 feet | <strong>Attachments:</strong> Crevice tool, dusting brush</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-carpet-aspiron-canister-vacuum-cleaner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Carpet</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aspiron Canister Vacuum Cleaner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Aspiron Canister Vacuum Cleaner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/AzC2r44CzVAlb06kHwNRyfrRT0g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/aspiron-canister-vacuum-cleaner-bf32752cdb6f4ae6b166e72323b03dfa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Emptying</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Noise Level</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>This vacuum has powerful suction for a budget-friendly price.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It easily picks up debris on low-pile carpeting.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It’s effective at picking up pet hair without tangling.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not all canister vacuums excel on carpeting, but in our testing, the Aspiron Canister Vacuum had no problem sucking up dirt and debris off rugs. In our tests, the vacuum picked up the majority of coffee grounds and pet hair off a low-pile carpet in just one pass, and we were surprised at its powerful suction, especially considering the model’s low price point. Plus, because the floorhead doesn’t have a classic brush roll, there was no pet hair tangled up in the vacuum, making for minimal maintenance and consistent suction power.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s a knob on the canister of this vacuum that allows you to adjust the suction power, and it has a telescoping wand that’s handy for cleaning high areas. The pet turbo tool was amazing for cleaning pet hair off upholstery, but we did find that the vacuum’s floor attachment would occasionally spit out larger debris, such as pieces of orzo pasta, forcing us to go back over them again. Still, you can’t beat the suction power and versatility of this vacuum for such a low price, especially if you have a lot of carpeting in your home.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $93.99 (orig. $123.16)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bagless | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 17 x 12.3 x 9.6 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 16 pounds | <strong>Capacity: </strong>3.5 liters | <strong>Hose Length:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Cord Length:</strong> 20 feet | <strong>Attachments:</strong> Crevice nozzle, dust brush, pet powermate attachment, upholstery brush</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-easiest-to-maneuver-shark-cz2001-vertex-canister-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Easiest to Maneuver</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Shark Canister Vacuum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Shark CZ2001 Vertex Canister Vacuum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/jA1OaN2v0ioIhr0Rur4gHtphrUI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shark-cz2001-vertex-canister-vacuum-09b26de7769d434d8323f2feb2f40581.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Emptying</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Noise Level</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>The vacuum rolls smoothly and is easy to pull around obstacles.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Its self-cleaning brush rolls don’t get tangled with hair.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The wand bends to clean underneath furniture.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Shark Vertex is a top choice if you have lots of obstacles in your home. During testing, it was able to maneuver around furniture and roll smoothly between carpeting and hard floors, and we never had any issues with it tipping over or getting stuck. It features the brand’s signature dual-brush roll design, which includes a soft roller to pick up fine particles on hard floors, and it was able to pick up the vast majority of debris in a single pass. (It didn’t do quite as well on carpeting, often needing five or more passes to capture all the debris we laid out.)&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Vertex has several other features that make it a worthwhile contender, too. Its wand bends in the middle, allowing you to easily clean under low-profile furniture, and it also has a non-tangle brush roll design with LED headlights. The bagless design weighs just 9 pounds, making it easy to carry around, and while it’s slightly expensive at its full price, this vacuum is definitely worth it if you can find it on sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $449.99 (orig. $479.99)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bagless | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 17.7 x 14.2 x 49.2 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 9 pounds | <strong>Capacity: </strong>1.8 liters | <strong>Hose Length:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Cord Length:</strong> 25 feet | <strong>Attachments:</strong> Pet crevice tool, upholstery tool</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-other-canister-vacuums-we-tried></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Other Canister Vacuums We Tried</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Eureka Mighty Mite Canister Cleaner</a>: </strong>Once you get the hang of it, this inexpensive vacuum does a good job cleaning debris off carpeting and hard floors, but there’s definitely a learning curve involved.

There are a few benefits to a bagged vacuum design — they often do a better job capturing allergens and dust, making sure these particles aren’t circulated back into your home. They’re also quick and easy to empty, as you simply remove the bag and replace it with a new one. The downside, however, is that you’ll have to invest in a supply of vacuum bags, which can be somewhat pricey, depending on the brand.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are also bagless canister vacuums, as well, including the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kenmore Compact Bagless Canister Vacuum</a>, which earned our top overall recommendation.

This term refers to the maximum distance away from a power outlet that you can use the vacuum, and it takes into account both the cord length and, in the case of canister vacuums, the vacuum’s hose length. When this measurement is higher, you’ll be able to cover more area without having to stop and find a new electrical outlet, and of all the vacuums we recommend, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Bissell SmartClean</a> has the best operating radius, thanks to its 30-foot retractable power cord.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To find the best canister vacuums available today, we gathered 16 top-rated models from brands like Miele, Kenmore, Shark, and more.

We used a mixture of materials, including sand, baking soda, Cheerios, uncooked orzo pasta, fake pet hair, and Chex cereal to evaluate each vacuum’s pickup abilities. We ran these tests on hard floors, low-pile carpeting, and tile floors, noting how many passes were required to pick up all the debris.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Maneuverability: </strong>We also wanted to see how easy it was to move each vacuum, as some canister models are prone to tipping over or getting stuck on obstacles. To test this, we set up an obstacle course, using each model to clean around furniture such as a coffee table, lamp, and couch, while pulling the canister along behind us.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Portability</strong>: To see how each vacuum performed on non-floor surfaces, we used them to clean debris off an upholstered chair, as well as carpeted stairs.

And by the way, companies can never buy our recommendation: Their products must earn it, fair and square.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In short, PEOPLE Tested provides recommendations you can trust — every day, every purchase.&nbsp;<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5KawLV5wpqloqukmr9uwsCcrK6lo2KFdXyWbW9x</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-canister-vacuums-8407488.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-canister-vacuums-8407488.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-canister-vacuums-8407488.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-canister-vacuums-8407488.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-canister-vacuums-8407488.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-canister-vacuums-8407488.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./carmen-montero-mundt-byin-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./carmen-montero-mundt-byin-html.html>Carmen Montero Mundt (Family Member) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./oscars-fans-concerned-nicole-kidman-bizarre-behavior.html>Oscars fans concerned for Nicole Kidman after actress displays bizarre behavior on the red carpet in</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./oscars-fans-concerned-nicole-kidman-bizarre-behavior.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
