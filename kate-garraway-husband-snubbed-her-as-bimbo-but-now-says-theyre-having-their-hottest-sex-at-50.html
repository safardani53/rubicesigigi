But I turned up and he was indeed serving wine to the congregation in a salmon-pink jumper," Kate later recalled.</p><h2>Dates in a hospital bed</h2><p>Love blossomed nonetheless, although just weeks later their fledgling relationship was put to the test when Kate developed a benign cyst in her kidney which doctors initially thought was cancer.</p><p>"When you’re a woman in that early dating phase you’re blow-dried, fake-tanned, silky-soft-skinned, but I was in a gown in a hospital bed with unshaven legs," she recalled.</p><p>Both later said that the illness made them determined to cement what they had and the&nbsp;couple tied the knot in north London in September 2005.</p><p>Among the guests were a number of Strictly stars, including Anton du Beke - who went on to become Kate’s professional partner in the fifth series of the show two years later - and Brendan Cole, from whom Derek was secretly having dance lessons for the wedding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NINTCHDBPICT000545043558.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NINTCHDBPICT000003671753-e1575474056872.jpg><h2>Hottest sex in their 50s</h2><p>The couple’s daughter Darcey, now thirteen, came along six months later followed by William, now ten.</p><p>And while Kate has been open about how much she loves being a mother she admits her one regret is that her age – she was 38 when she had Darcey – meant she couldn’t have as many children as she would have liked.</p><p>"I wish I’d had children younger in some ways… I would definitely have had loads more,’"she once said.</p><p>As well as family time the couple make a point of getting away on their own at least twice a year to spend some quality time together, while Kate has been open about the fact that she finds sex in her fifties far more enjoyable as she’s less self-conscious about 'putting on a show'.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN TV SHOWBIZ</h2></p><p>Her down to earth approach - together with that red bikini – is no doubt one reason she’s won so many new admirers - among them her fellow camp dweller Myles Stephenson.</p><p>The Rak-su star, 28, has flirted outrageously with her in recent days and earlier this week announced that Kate was his ‘telly crush’.</p><p>His admission led to Derek confessing that he had been left a bit "jealous and paranoid" – although he needn’t worry too much: as he told Lorraine Kelly, "she’s coming home to me".</p><p>As her stint in the jungle cements her place as one of nation's most fancied presenters, Derek knows he's a lucky man.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NINTCHDBPICT000544819121.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Nadine Coyle and Kate Garraway join Caitlyn Jenner in the I’m A Celebrity 2019 shower</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWihnWKubq%2FEpZybZ2FlgXl%2Bk3BnaKORqbJus8CrqZqvka56qcHSm5innF2ou7auwZ6bZqCVp3qiv4yboKaan2KvtsCMp6awZaOWxrR506GcsqqVYrWiwsinnmasmJq2s3nHqKutnaOperSx12aYrWVlZXw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkate-garraway-husband-snubbed-her-as-bimbo-but-now-says-theyre-having-their-hottest-sex-at-50.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkate-garraway-husband-snubbed-her-as-bimbo-but-now-says-theyre-having-their-hottest-sex-at-50.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkate-garraway-husband-snubbed-her-as-bimbo-but-now-says-theyre-having-their-hottest-sex-at-50.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkate-garraway-husband-snubbed-her-as-bimbo-but-now-says-theyre-having-their-hottest-sex-at-50.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkate-garraway-husband-snubbed-her-as-bimbo-but-now-says-theyre-having-their-hottest-sex-at-50.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkate-garraway-husband-snubbed-her-as-bimbo-but-now-says-theyre-having-their-hottest-sex-at-50.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./pat-cummins-wife-becky-boston-wedding.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./pat-cummins-wife-becky-boston-wedding.html>Inside Pat Cummins And Wife Becky Bostons Wedding</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sahana-srinivasans-boyfriend-list.html>Sahana Srinivasans Boyfriend: Who is Sahana Srinivasan Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sahana-srinivasans-boyfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
