You're such a drama queen!"</p><p>The singer then told her: "Is that not true? I just want you to know that I know and real lives have been affected."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000644394417.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000647044957.jpg><p>After LaToya asked her again what she was talking about, she explained: "Didn't you tell Cynthia that you met someone from Texas? And the prophet is from Texas! And he broke up with his fiance and he has a baby?"</p><p>When LaToya once more denied ever hooking up with the prophet, Drew told her: "I can't have a conversation with someone who can't keep it real. It's not no made up story but if you just don't want to be honest then that's fine. But if you're in a spiritual journey, then the first thing you have to do is tell the truth."</p><p>LaToya quickly hit back and said: "Well the first thing you have to do is shut the f**k up because you don't know what you're talking about.</p><p>"I was on a four-week program with him. He was advising me spiritually every Wednesday."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000626929677.jpg><p>Drew refused to drop the subject and said: "Is that why your mom said you got a hotel room with Prophet Lott? Am I lying?"</p><p>"Yeah," LaToya told her. "I am not talking to no Prophet Lott and if I was, why the hell wouldn't I say so. You don't know what's going on in my life."</p><p>During a confessional interview, Drew told producers: "LaToya is a disrespectful little thing. She's over here breaking families and I really have an issue, I can't stand by and allow that to happen with people I care about."</p><p>She then described LaToya as a Delilah, which she described as a "woman who uses her sexuality and projects that sex spirit unto others."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000647046042.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000647045533.jpg><p>Later on in the episode, the housewives caught Kenya Moore on what had gone down at the pop-up store and LaToya decided to FaceTime with the prophet to clear things up.</p><p>When LaToya asked if he was supposed to bless Drew's youngest daughter, he said: "I was supposed to be part of that and I never heard back from them. After some confusion came up with me advising you spiritually."</p><p>Kandi then asked him if he had a relationship with LaToya, he said: "The assistant that was involved was being really messy and because he was the one who introduced me to them, I think it became this intimidation tactic because the assiatnt and I had a friendship and when he noticed I had a connection with LaToya, everyone got emotional.</p><p>"I never admitted that to them, I just admitted to them that I was advising her and I am not going to allow anyone to control me. This is what I do."</p><p>He then denied that he had a sexual relationship with LaToya and said that he was engaged three years ago, further denying that the Canadian YouTuber broke his home.</p><p>LaToya is currently in the midst of divorcing the father of her three children, Adam.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>This is certainly not the first time that the two new women have butted heads.</p><p>Most recently, <a href=#>Drew threatened to put LaToya's head through a gate</a> for grabbing her hand when making an offensive comment about her husband, Ralph.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000632522568.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hqZm2Den%2BTaKmhp5FisbOx1maqopyfp65urcKcrKydo2K5osDOsphmmZyeeqS0xJqroqaXYrW2v8GapZ1n</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frhoa-drew-sidora-accuses-latoya-ali-cheating-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frhoa-drew-sidora-accuses-latoya-ali-cheating-husband.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frhoa-drew-sidora-accuses-latoya-ali-cheating-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frhoa-drew-sidora-accuses-latoya-ali-cheating-husband.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frhoa-drew-sidora-accuses-latoya-ali-cheating-husband.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frhoa-drew-sidora-accuses-latoya-ali-cheating-husband.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cardi-b-lil-kim-twitter.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cardi-b-lil-kim-twitter.html>What did Cardi B say about Lil Kim?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./isabelle-wffs-html.html>Isabelle (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./isabelle-wffs-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
