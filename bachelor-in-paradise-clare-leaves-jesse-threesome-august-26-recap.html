Michelle ran&nbsp;after him to make sure he was ok, to see that he was actually having an anxiety attack. However, he pulled it together and accepted the rose from AshLee. This in turn, caused Lacy to get sick… literally. She had to be carted away in an ambulance, with Marcus, her husband fling by her side.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>However, the show must go on. It was Michelle’s turn to give out her rose and she chose&nbsp;<strong>Cody</strong>;&nbsp;<strong>Sarah&nbsp;</strong>chose&nbsp;<strong>Robert</strong>; and&nbsp;<strong>Jackie</strong> chose&nbsp;<strong>Jesse</strong> (for some reason), sending home&nbsp;<strong>Marquel</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Kalon</strong>. (<strong>Clare&nbsp;</strong>had already chosen&nbsp;<b>Zack</b> after an intense eggs-in-your-basket talk, and&nbsp;<strong>Lacy</strong> of course had chosen <b>Marcus</b> before&nbsp;getting sick.)</p><h3>Clare&nbsp;Isn’t Here For The Drama, You Guys</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>The newcomers this week definitely shook things up —&nbsp;<strong>Christy</strong> from&nbsp;<strong>Juan Pablo</strong>‘s season was first. Right away, Zack admitted that he met Christy&nbsp;before and knew she was into him, and that he was actually hoping she’d be there at the beginning. She immediately tried convincing him to go on the date, but&nbsp;he said no, out of respect for Clare.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>However, after&nbsp;they had just agreed their eggs were all in each other’s baskets, Zack still had to tell Clare&nbsp;he felt they were going too fast, totally catching her off guard. She already went through that with&nbsp;Juan Pablo and “either you’re into it or you’re not into it.” So, her solution to get away was to run off into the jungle, but there&nbsp;was another raccoon to vent to. Phew.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Unfortunately, she did&nbsp;decide to go home — not before a moment for Zack to ask her to stay, which he didn’t. However, the line of the night was, “This is why I wanted to do&nbsp;Dancing with the Stars.” Oh, Clarebear. We’ll miss you.</p><h3>Let’s Fall In Love & Get Married</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>As for the happy couples, Sarah and Robert went on their date together and she couldn’t wait to finally kiss him. He waited a long time but&nbsp;once they did finally make out, it was h-o-t.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Michelle also got a date and chose Cody, who was already crazy about her. Their first date was a photo shoot on the beach and while she wanted to pump the breaks a little, she&nbsp;had to put on&nbsp;a wedding dress for the pics, so that kind of did the opposite. Regardless #TeamCody over here.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Marcus and Lacy are pretty much married by now, so it wasn’t surprising that he told her he loved her while they were standing on the beach. L-O-V-E.</p><h3>Threesomes In Paradise?</h3><p id=content-paragraph-10>While some were finding love, others were finding… lust.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>After Zack said no to the date with Christy, she&nbsp;took out the only single one,&nbsp;<strong>Jesse</strong>, who she was convinced was a good guy… until he started talking about what he would&nbsp;say if he were a “douchebag.” Oh wait, she still liked him after that. They end up getting wasted together and coming back to the house and making out.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>However, the other newcomer&nbsp;was&nbsp;<strong>Lucy</strong>, who you may remember as the “Free Spirit” from Juan Pablo’s&nbsp;season. Naturally, she was naked within minutes and also chose Jesse&nbsp;for her date… which also ended in an intense make out. It&nbsp;made it that much stranger when&nbsp;he&nbsp;then made out with Christy (again)&nbsp;after returning and ended up in a bed with her. Not to worry thought&nbsp;—&nbsp;Lucy thought&nbsp;“sharing is caring” so… she joined in.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>[Side note: for most it’s a disadvantage coming in later because everyone’s taken, but it seems to work for Jesse, since he’s everyone’s only choice.]</p><h3>And The Rose Goes To</h3><p id=content-paragraph-14>So, when it came time for the rose ceremony, it was time for Jesse to chose who was better in bed… er, who he wanted to find love with.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>First was the lovey-dovey couples: Robert chose Sarah,Graham chose AshLee, Cody chose Michelle, and Marcus chose Lacy. Zack decided on Jackie, now that Clare was gone. Last but not least,&nbsp;Jesse chose Christy, sending the naked free spirit packing (even though she probably didn’t have much to pack).</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>What did you think of the episode,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>? Do you think Clare made the right choice? Do you think Jessie chose the right one?
