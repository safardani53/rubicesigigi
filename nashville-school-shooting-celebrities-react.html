I will never understand why this keeps happening. And why children are dying because our country is failing to put laws in place that protect them. The fact that there are laws to “protect” children from drag queens and not gun violence is INFURIATING to me. Can’t believe my daughter has to grow up and go to school where she has to learn how to lock down for a gunman in daycare when she should only have to worry about learning how to color and play.
