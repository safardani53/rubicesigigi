It was magnificent action.</p><p>Yarde lost his gumshield again at the start of the fifth, a worrying sign of early exhaustion as he gasped through his mouth instead of his nose.</p><p>But then Beterbiev was buzzed by an arrow of a Yarde right hand and looked in deep danger.</p><p>Somehow the Soviet beard absorbed the blow and he ended the round battering Yarde, the challenger did incredibly well to make the bell.</p><p>Yarde’s right eye was a mess by the time the sixth started, he needed a miracle to survive, let alone spring the upset.</p><p>Our man kept jabbing at his rival and dabbing at his oozing eye and then he caught a left hook that would have fallen anyone without a heart as huge as his.</p><p>By round seven Yarde had scythed a gash into Beterbiev’s left eye too. This was a brilliant bloodbath.</p><p>Yarde landed heavy scoring shots in the seventh but at the end of the session he got pinned into Beterbiev’s blue corner and took a pasting.</p><p>Yarde’s spirit looked broken in the eighth when he was finally floored and looked beaten.</p><p>But he somehow dragged himself off of the canvas to beat ref Steve Gray’s count and was desperate to continue.</p><p>But concerned trainer Tunde Ajayi had seen enough and threw in the towel to protect his man for another title tilt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9xgJdubm9tX5a7tbTOp7BmsZGnsaZ5wKurrqpdl7K1sdGboJ6uXaG2t7GMq5ysrZyperTA0Z6YpmWjqa6zwIytoKadXanDbq%2FHmqWnnZxiuaLAxKyraA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fanthony-yarde-artur-beterbiev-live-result-stream-start-time-tv-channel-latest.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fanthony-yarde-artur-beterbiev-live-result-stream-start-time-tv-channel-latest.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fanthony-yarde-artur-beterbiev-live-result-stream-start-time-tv-channel-latest.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fanthony-yarde-artur-beterbiev-live-result-stream-start-time-tv-channel-latest.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fanthony-yarde-artur-beterbiev-live-result-stream-start-time-tv-channel-latest.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fanthony-yarde-artur-beterbiev-live-result-stream-start-time-tv-channel-latest.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./miranda-lambert-acm-awards-2023-dress-performance-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./miranda-lambert-acm-awards-2023-dress-performance-photos.html>Miranda Lambert At ACM Awards 2023 Plunging Blue Dress Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tyler-blackburn-vacations-with-girlfriend-lauren-hoover-pictures-201477.html>Tyler Blackburn Vacations With Girlfriend Lauren Hoover: Pictures</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tyler-blackburn-vacations-with-girlfriend-lauren-hoover-pictures-201477.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
