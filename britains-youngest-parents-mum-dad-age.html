Can't believe it, four girls, good luck Darren."</p><p>As the expectant <a href=#>mother</a> shares her happy news, we look back at Tressa's heartwrenching story and what happened next to Britain's other youngest <a href=#>parents</a>.</p><h2>Horrific attack</h2><p>Tressa was just 11 years old when her pregnancy became known and was believed to have been the result of an alcohol-related encounter.</p><p>Raised in a troubled home with a mother who had addiction issues, Tressa gave birth shortly after leaving primary school.</p><p>Her child was removed from her care and adopted two years after she gave birth, after the young mum struggled with depression and addictions to alcohol and cigarettes.</p><p>The father's identity remained a secret until 2009 when the young mum broke down and revealed to authorities that she had been <a href=#>raped by her older brother Jason</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>Jason, now 34, was <a href=#>jailed</a> for four years in 2009 after being incriminated by DNA evidence and was revealed to have sexually abused her from the age of seven.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/i-fear-babys-stopped-growing-3725490.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/faces-pixellated-published-version-12-301638567.jpg><p>In 2011, Tressa told the <a href=# aria-label="Daily Mail (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a>: "'Sometimes he bribed me, blackmailed me, to do it.</p><p>"He'd say he was going to tell Mum. He'd give me things - joints, drink, cigarettes. Or he'd threaten me."</p><p>Since then, Tressa has fought to piece her life back together and managed to get clean after developing a £400-a-day heroin addiction.</p><p>She is now expecting her third child with partner Darren Young.</p><h2>UK's most recent youngest mum</h2><p>Tressa held onto the title of Britain's youngest mum for 15 years until The Sun reported an <a href=#>11-year-old had given birth in 2021</a>.</p><p>The girl, who was not named for legal reasons, was raped when she was just 10.</p><p>Her family had no idea about the horrific attack and at the time, social services investigated the case.</p><p>"It has come as a big shock," a source who knew the family told The Sun in 2021.</p><p>"She’s now being surrounded by expert help. The main thing is that she and the baby are OK."</p><h2>Baby-faced dad</h2><p>When it was revealed that Alfie Patten was to become father at 13 years old, the story garnered widespread attention.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/alfie-patten-claimed-britains-youngest-516838913.jpg><p>Even, then Prime Minister <a href=#>David Cameron</a> commented on the 2009 <a href=#>case</a>, who was believed to have become a father before being old enough to legally purchase party poppers.</p><p>"I just thought how worrying that in Britain today children are having children," the Tory leader said at the time.</p><p>Alfie thought he'd got his 15-year-old girlfriend Chantelle Steadman pregnant when he was just 12 after they had sex at a sleepover in Lower Dicker, East Sussex.</p><p>But a DNA test six weeks after baby Maisie's birth proved that he wasn't actually the father. Later, 14-year-old Tyler Barker claimed to be the child's real dad.</p><p>"I was devastated," <a href=#>Alfie told The Sun</a> in 2014. "It was too much to take in. I cried for days and barely left my room.</p><p>“To make things worse I never saw Maisie again because Chantelle and her family moved away as soon as they found out I wasn’t the dad.</p><p>“I couldn’t face doing anything. I couldn’t go to school. I thought my world had ended."</p><p>By 2019, Alfie was unemployed, battling alcoholism and <a href=#>dealing with legal troubles</a>.</p><p>He was convicted of criminal damage after smashing up cars while already on a suspended sentence for shoplifting, theft and possession of an imitation firearm.</p><p>In March 2021, he and his mum were booted out of their home for alleged drug dealing, the <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a> reported.</p><h2>UK's youngest father</h2><p>Before Alfie's case, <a href=#>Sean Stewart</a> was beleived to be Britain's youngest dad back in 1998.</p><p>He was just 11 when he impregnated his 15-year-old next door neighbour Emma Webster.</p><p>Sean was then given the day off school when son Ben Louis was born a month after Sean's 12th birthday.</p><p>The couple were neighbours in the village of Sharnbrook, Bedfordshire, when they began a sexual relationship.</p><p>It was reported at the time that Sean used to clamber across the roof to meet Emma.</p><p>At the time, she told The Sunday Telegraph: "He said he was 12, I'd never have gone out with him if I'd known he was 11."</p><p>In the years after, Emma went on to marry another person and moved into a £200,000 home.</p><p>Sean continued to attend his local school for a while, but moved away from Bedfordshire in his early teen years.</p><p>In the late 2000s, he was jailed for seven months following an allegation of theft, the <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a> reports.</p><p>Emma, who planned to return to school after the birth, said at the time: "I don't know where Sean is or what he is doing.</p><p>"I don't want to talk about it anymore because I don't think it helps Ben."</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">What does the law say?</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>The legal age of consent in the UK is 16.</p><p>The law is there to protect young people from abuse, harm or being taken advantage of by adults.</p><p>It is not designed to criminalise young people and there is no intention to prosecute people under the age of 16 where both mutually agree (consent) and where they are of a similar age.</p><p>But children under the age of 13 are considered too young to be able to consent.</p><p>Therefore any sexual activity with someone under 13 is illegal and considered rape, sexual abuse or assault.</p><p>For more information, visit <a href=#>Brook</a>.</p><p>Children aged 13-15 are therefore unlikely to be prosecuted as long as there isn't a large age difference between partners and sex is consensual.</p><h2>Hid baby bump</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kathleen-mum-12-child-mum-824953096.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/200-print-exclusive-kathleen-moss-824942502-1.jpg><p>Kathleen Moss was just 12 years old when she had her daughter Georgia, in 1998.</p><p>It was revealed the youngster had sex with a 14-year-old family friend while on holiday at a Butlin's park in Pwllheli, north Wales.</p><p>At the time, Kathleen, from Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, told the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a> it happened because they were "bored".</p><p>She added: "I didn’t realise I was pregnant until after about four or five months when my tummy started to get bigger, because I was still having periods.</p><p>"I was terrified and just went into denial. I thought that if I ignored it, it would just go away."</p><p>Kathleen wore baggy clothes to hide her growing bump but eventually her family's suspicion grew.</p><p>A pregnancy test confirmed she was expecting and, in June 1998, she gave birth to Georgia.</p><p>Kathleen said: "I regret falling pregnant so young, but how could I ever regret having Georgia? I can’t imagine life without her.</p><p>"Even though I was only 12, the minute she was put in my arms I just felt overwhelmed with love for her."</p><p>In 2011, when Georgia turned 12, Kathleen spoke to the <a aria-label="Daily Mail (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a> and revealed her daughter, thankfully, had no interest in boys at that stage.</p><p>Instead, she said her child was focused on going to college and studying to become a vet.</p><p>Kathleen added: "When I look at her (Georgia), I find it hard to believe that at her age I was already a mother. She seems so young.</p><p>"I had to grow up overnight, but I’m proud that Georgia can still be a child and I’m very protective of her innocence,’ says Kathleen."</p><p>Kathleen and Georgia have kept a low profile since.</p><h2>Clueless until labour</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/200-per-image-wearing-school-824952743.jpg><p>Young mum Charlotte Maddox didn't even realise she was pregnant until she went into labour at 13 years old.</p><p>Previously, the teen dismissed stomach pains as a tummy bug after being impregnated by a 15-year-old boy.</p><p>She also put weight gain down to overeating and her parents didn't notice anything unusual.</p><p>In 2006, she was shocked when she went into labour.</p><p>"I was screaming in pain and shouted: 'I've got to push something, it's coming!'" Charlotte told <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mirror</a>.</p><p>"That was the first time I realised I was pregnant and about to become a mum."</p><p>She also revealed her shock over seeing her life transformed in a matter of hours from worrying about homework to raising a child.</p><p>"I kept thinking, 'This can't be true, this isn't real,'" Charlotte said.</p><p>"I can't do long division but I can make a little person. It doesn't seem right at my age."</p><p>Charlotte has also remained out of the public eye since giving birth.</p><h2>World's youngest mum was five</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/nintchdbpict000300154236.jpg><p>The youngest mother ever recorded in the world is <a href=#>Lina Medina</a>, a Peruvian woman who gave birth when she was five years old in 1939.</p><p>Medina, who is now 89, had a condition called "precocious puberty" which causes puberty to begin before the typical range.
