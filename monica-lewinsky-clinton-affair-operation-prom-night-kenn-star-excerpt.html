Tripp famously secretly recorded her phone conversations with Lewinsky about the latter’s affair with the president when she was 22-year-old.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Our team dubbed the operation ‘Prom Night.’ Fresh from the gym, wearing purple sweats, Monica arrived,” Starr writes of Lewinsky’s arrival at the arranged meeting spot, the Ritz-Carlton, according to NPR.

The meeting turned into a marathon.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lewinsky asked for her lawyer and, when Starr’s team reiterated that she wasn’t under arrest, requested that they wait until her mother, Marcia Lewis, arrived, according to the NPR excerpt.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hours later, Lewis arrived.

I mean, it was just violation after violation.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Brian Doben</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lewinsky didn’t actually meet Ken Starr until 20 years after the investigation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>a February 2018 essay</a> for Vanity Fair pegged to this year’s anniversary of the White House scandal, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Lewinsky revealed she first met Starr randomly</a> at a restaurant on Christmas Eve in 2017.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She recalled how difficult it was to meet the man who “turned my 24-year-old life into a living hell in his effort to investigate and prosecute President Bill Clinton” and who, with his team of prosecutors “hounded and terrorized” not only her, but her family.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Ken Starr asked me several times if I was ‘doing O.K.’ A stranger might have surmised from his tone that he had actually worried about me over the years,” she recalled. “His demeanor, almost pastoral, was somewhere between avuncular and creepy. He kept touching my arm and elbow, which made me uncomfortable.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lewinsky introduced Starr to her family, writing that she was “a bit thrown” by the surreal run-in, but determined to seize the chance to speak her truth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I finally gathered my wits about me—after an internal command of Get it together,“she explained. ” ‘Though I wish I had made different choices back then,’ I stammered, ‘I wish that you and your office had made different choices, too.’ In hindsight, I later realized, I was paving the way for him to apologize. But he didn’t. He merely said, with the same inscrutable smile, ‘I know. It was unfortunate.’ “</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CkuarAyJyqaKWfo7akrYylnLChnqi4unnCpaCnrJ%2BjeqKyxZqgq2WfpbKzrdOipqdloKe8rnnNop6hrF2gsq%2B6jKyrmqpdmsWksdGpq2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmonica-lewinsky-clinton-affair-operation-prom-night-kenn-star-excerpt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmonica-lewinsky-clinton-affair-operation-prom-night-kenn-star-excerpt.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmonica-lewinsky-clinton-affair-operation-prom-night-kenn-star-excerpt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmonica-lewinsky-clinton-affair-operation-prom-night-kenn-star-excerpt.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmonica-lewinsky-clinton-affair-operation-prom-night-kenn-star-excerpt.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmonica-lewinsky-clinton-affair-operation-prom-night-kenn-star-excerpt.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./von-miller-ex-girlfriend-megan-denise-pregnancy-instagram.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./von-miller-ex-girlfriend-megan-denise-pregnancy-instagram.html>Who is Von Miller's ex-girlfriend Megan Denise?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lincoln-cent-rare-find-coin-rolling.html>I found a $24,000 holy grail coin after taking up a new mundane hobby - my exact method to find rari</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lincoln-cent-rare-find-coin-rolling.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
