You better hope he’ll find it in him, maybe, to forgive the sinner he’s made you.”</p><p>I am told it is an outtake from a demo of 2015’s 25 and has nothing to do with her upcoming fourth album.</p><p>But if more new music were to leak, it could cost her millions in lost sales.</p><p>A music insider said: “Adele’s campaigns are always shrouded in secrecy and that is what made her return in 2015 so exciting.</p><p>“There was real hype to hear her voice again and everyone rushed out to buy her record.</p><p>“But if her next album leaks it could be disastrous. It could have a dent on her sales figures and also taint her entire return to music.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000617027802.jpg><p>“Her team are doing all they can to keep everything under wraps but this is certainly alarming.”</p><p>Lady Gaga, Dua Lipa and Ariana Grande have already had albums leaked in the past year before they were released.</p><p>Two demos from Adele’s album 21 surfaced in 2014, three years after it was released.</p><p>In October, Adele revealed during her first public appearance since 2017 that she was still working on her forthcoming album.</p><p>Addressing why she wasn’t performing while hosting US comedy show Saturday Night Live, she said: “My album’s not finished and I’m also too scared to do both.</p><p>“I’d rather put on some wigs, have a glass of wine or six and just see what happens.”</p><p>Hopefully the leak will give her the motivation she needs to release the album sooner rather than later.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Tina and Amy back</h2><p>TINA Fey and Amy Poehler will co-host the Golden Globes – beaming separately from opposite coasts of America</p><p>It is their first time in the role since 2015.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000634035501.jpg><p>The award ceremony is being hosted from New York and Beverly Hills to allow for social distancing within two different venues.</p><p>The pair have hosted together three times before, but this one will certainly be different.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Outbreak of global fairness</h3></p><p>IT finally happened... there is nothing for me to rage about. After years of tearing my hair out over equality and representation, the Golden Globes have finally got it right, and it’s fantastic news.</p><p>Across a huge raft of categories, the annual bash – this year on Zoom, sadly, instead of a glitzy ceremony – represents a wonderfully diverse range of talent, covering all that global entertainment can offer.</p><p>And nowhere is that more clear than in the Best Director category – where three of the five nominees are women.</p><p>Clearly, that shouldn’t be a huge surprise – and yet even in 2021 it is still ground-breaking. At the Oscars, for example, only five women have been nominated in 92 years – with Kathryn Bigelow the one winner.</p><p>And last year Greta Gerwig became the latest big name to be snubbed by the Academy – despite the brilliance of her incarnation of Little Women.</p><p>But yesterday’s decision to name Emerald Fennell, Regina King and Chloe Zhao in contention for the coveted Director gong at the Globes alongside Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher marked a major victory, whoever wins on the night.</p><p>Let’s hope the other events follow suit. Baftas, Oscars, Emmys... we’re watching.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Crown jewels</h2><p>THE Golden Globes celebrate screen talent from around world but it’s the Brits who are ruling supreme this year.</p><p>This year’s nods for the annual US bash, beamed online from LA and New York on February 28, were announced yesterday and British-made TV series The Crown reigned supreme with six.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000634154657.jpg><p>Newcomer Emma Corrin, who played Princess Diana in the royal drama, is in the running for Best Movie Actress (Drama).</p><p>Her screen huband Josh O’Connor, who took a bow as Prince Charles, gets the same shout-out in the male category.</p><p>Emma is up against her Crown co-star Olivia Colman, who plays the Queen. But if Olivia misses out, she is also in the frame for Best Movie Supporting Actress for family drama The Father.</p><p>Gillian Anderson, who played former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in The Crown, and Helena Bonham-Carter, who was Princess Margaret, go head to head for Best TV Supporting Actress.</p><p>Emma posted on Instagram: “A real honour to be named amongst a group of such talented and inspirational women. Working on The Crown was the most magical experience, in no small part thanks to incredible cast and crew that supported and helped guide me.”</p><p>The ceremony will also be a big night for Emerald Fennell, who channelled Camilla in The Crown, as she is up for Best Director and Best Screenplay for her movie thriller Promising Young Woman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000634154668.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000634153302.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000634154646.jpg><p>Other British talent who are recognised include Jodie Comer, for her part in BBC spy thriller Killing Eve and James Corden for his role in Netflix musical comedy flick The Prom.</p><p>Nicholas Hoult gets a nod for his turn in US-made telly drama The Great — about Russian empress Catherine the Great — and Carey Mulligan for her part in Promising Young Woman.</p><p>Brit Gary Ooldman stars in movie biopic Mank, which leads the way in film nods with six and tells the story of Citizen Kane film screenwriter Herman Jacob Mankiewicz.</p><p>Now the Golden Globes need to work out how to put on a good show Stateside when all of their winners are on the other side of the Pond</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">...and the non-inations</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/867173ad-08b4-4108-b64a-7707f945c755.jpg><p>NORMAL People’s Daisy Edgar-Jones was nominated for her portrayal of Marianne in the BBC drama but her co-star Paul Mescal was snub-bed in the shortlist – a reverse of their Emmy experience last year.</p><p>And Paul’s wasn’t the only snub – Michaela Coel’s sex assault drama I May Destroy You received no recognition, despite being one of the most critically acclaimed shows of the last year, as did Bridgerton, starring British actors Phoebe Dynevor and Rege-Jean Page.</p><p>Also ignored were Tom Hanks and Zendaya, who have had big years in cinema, and even the box office’s one major success story of the past 12 months, Tenet, was only acknowledged in the Best Original Score category.</p><p>Some may find that decision as baffling as the film’s plot, which, to be fair, made no sense to me.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Golden Globe Awards nominations</h2><h4>TV SERIES:</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/867173ad-08b4-4108-b64a-7707f945c755.jpg><p><strong>The Crown</strong>: 6<br><strong>Schitt’s Creek</strong>: 5<br><strong>Ozark</strong>: 4<br><strong>The Great</strong>: 3<br><strong>Emily In Paris</strong>: 2<br><strong>Normal People</strong>: 2<br><strong>Ted Lasso</strong>: 2</p><h4>MOVIES:</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/aj-pg13-comp.jpg><p><strong>Mank</strong>: 6<br><strong>The Trial Of The Chicago 7</strong>: 5<br><strong>The Father</strong>: 4<br><strong>Nomadland</strong>: 4<br><strong>Promising Young Woman</strong>: 4<br><strong>One Night In Miami</strong>: 3</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Deserves the recognition</h2><p>CHADWICK Boseman received a posthumous nomination following his death last August.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/aj-p13girl-comp.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Bizarre</h2></p><p>The actor, who had kept his colon cancer secret before his devastating passing aged just 43, is in the running for the Best Actor (Drama) gong for his part in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom – his final film role.</p><p>He is up against Tahar Rahim for The Mauritanian, and Brits Riz Ahmed for Sound Of Metal, Gary Oldman for Mank and Sir Anthony Hopkins for The Father.
