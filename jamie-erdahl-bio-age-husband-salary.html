Her parents were incredible sports enthusiasts; this passion translated into Jamie’s.</p><p>Eventually, the Minnesotan picked up basketball and softball when in high school. She attended a preparatory school called Breck School and graduated in 2007.</p><p>After that, Jamie enrolled in St. Olaf College, where her true dedication to sports could take flight. She discovered that sports wouldn’t cut it, leading Erdahl to transfer to American University.</p><p>By this time, her love for sports was so deeply engraved that the Minnesotan found hope in pursuing broadcasting and communications. This degree would keep her in tune with the sporting world and provide accessibility she otherwise wouldn’t have.</p><h2>Age, Height, & Body Measurements</h2><p>The blonde sports <a href=# rel=noopener>reporter</a> is 34 years old in 2023. After serving as a sports reporter for 12 years, the Minnesotan still hopes to thrive in the industry for years to come.</p><p>Moving on, like all sideline reporters, Erdahl maintains her composed persona and is truly a joy to watch.</p><p>Despite a constant hassle and the wrath that sideline reporters occasionally face, Jamie remains cool and collected and just forgets the incident like it never happened.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jamie-Erdahl-On-The-Site-For-Reporting.jpg></p><p>Besides, the 5’7″/1.73 m tall American has a friendly presence and seems easy-going, whereas her weight statistics is at 55 kg/122 lb.&nbsp;</p><p>As per her profession, she has a fit body even after giving birth; Erdahl’s weight and body proportions haven’t changed.</p><h2>Sideline Reporting Career&nbsp;</h2><p>Before becoming professional, Jamie opted for an internship at Comcast Sports Net in Washington, wherein she would host a 30-minute magazine show.</p><p>After that, with a certified degree, she was recruited to New England Sports Network (NESN) late.</p><p>Her job was joint hosting and reporting. In New England, the channel was quite popular among fans, and the hosts, Adam Pellerin and Erdahl, came in high demand.</p><p>The Minnesotan filled in for <a href=# rel=noopener>Jenny Dell</a> to cover Boston Red Sox’s games in 2013. Dell had to drop from hosting duties due to personal reasons. This was the exact moment when Jamie made an impact with her coverage.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/zxcgvbnm.png></p><p>Subsequently, Erdahl received a promotion to rinkside and, at the same time, juggled her time between studios and sidelines. Jamie’s main task at the studio was hosting a 30-minute news program.</p><p>According to records, she was a freelance <a href=# rel=noopener>reporter</a> for FOX Sports, for whom she covered events about the WNBA team Minnesota Lynx for a live telecast. A few years of experience at NESN opened the door to CBS Sports.</p><p>To this date, Jamie is an employee at CBS and assists <a href=# rel=noopener>Greg Gumbel</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Trent Green</a> with her valuable coverage and research. After the firing of <a href=#>Allie LaForce</a> in late 2018, Erdahl became a leading on-site journalist, mainly for CBS Sports’ affiliate SEC.</p><p>She joined NFL Network’s Good Morning Football (GMFB) as co-host in 2022.</p><p>On 7 January 2023, she took an Instagram to educate people about CPR training. Moreover, she thanked the American Heart Association for its incredible job in spreading awareness.</p><h2>Salary & Income</h2><p>In particular, Jamie has been present in the reporting scenario for almost a decade, and she has accumulated a net worth between <strong>$1 million-$5 million</strong> in 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>The Minnesotan pockets an annual wage of $95k, which is a pretty impressive salary.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Sdfghn.png></p><p>Likewise, her husband, Sam Buckman, is a former football player, and despite his successful career history, we can assume that he earned quite well as a professional player.</p><h2>Husband & Kids</h2><p>Indeed, a beautiful and hardworking woman like Jamie is a married woman. She found love with a man named Sam Buckman. Sam is a former football player who attended the University of Michigan.</p><p>Having forsaken his football career, Buckman acquired an Arts degree from Minnesota University and a Bachelor’s degree from Michigan. It is unclear when Sam and Jamie started dating, but their relationship became official in 2012.</p><p>When Erdahl was employed at NESN, the two moved in together and ultimately engaged in 2016. However, the wedding bells didn’t take long to ring because, on July 23, 2017, the couple exchanged vows and united in holy matrimony.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jamie-Erdahl-With-Her-Family.jpg></p><p>Two years into their marriage, the excited couple took to social media to announce that they were ready for a baby.</p><p>Thus, on July 12, 2019, the family of two became three after welcoming their first daughter, Brooke Marie Buckman. On May 20, 2021, they welcomed another baby girl Avery Buckman.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Jamie Erdahl is available on social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.
