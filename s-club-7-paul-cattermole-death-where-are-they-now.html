Hannah and the rest of the gang broke down when told what happened. No one can believe it. There is a real sense of horror and disbelief.”</p><p>Paul was one of the original members of S Club 7 when it formed in 1998, before leaving the band in 2002 to set up new group Skua.</p><p>But it was no easy ride for the singer, who told Loose Women in 2018 that he'd run out of money and had to borrow a shirt for the show.</p><p>The singer, who dated co-star Hannah for five years, even put his Brit Award on eBay saying: "There are bills to pay."</p><p>Paul, who was declared bankrupt in 2014, said he contacted Strictly Come Dancing producers and asked for a spot on the show.</p><p>He did pop up&nbsp;on First Dates Hotel in 2019 and, while his date wasn't keen for anything romantic, S Club fans were thrilled.</p><p>After 10 years of soul-searching and meditation, the&nbsp;star launched a new career as a spiritual coach and psychic, and had his own YouTube channel offering&nbsp;tarot card readings.</p><h2>Rachel Stevens</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/COMP_LY_RACHEL-S-SCLUB7-2.jpg> <img

over, making an instant impact with her No2 debut single Sweet Dreams My LA Ex.</p><p>She went on to achieve seven top 40 singles and boasts two solo albums.</p><p>Rachel was also one half of a pop-culture power couple with her boyfriend, Hollyoaks and Holby City actor <a href=#>Jeremy Edwards</a>.</p><p>He proposed on Valentine's Day in 2002 but they broke up two years later.</p><p>Rachel went on to reconcile with childhood sweetheart&nbsp;Alex Bourne, whom she wed in 2009, and the couple share two daughters, Minnie and Amelie.</p><p>But she's reportedly now single, after a shock split from&nbsp;Alex last year.</p><p>Earlier this month she revealed she'd moved out of their family home and is in the process of settling into her new pad.</p><p>Rachel, a <a href=#>superstar in the era of the lads' mags</a>, had a successful turn on Strictly Come Dancing in 2008 and last year's Dancing on Ice, and now has her own fashion collection with Oasis.</p><h2><strong>Jo O'Meara</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/COMP_LY_JO-SCLUB7.jpg><p>Always regarded as the vocal powerhouse, Jo, 43, launched a solo career after the band split.</p><p>Her then-manager, Spice Girls supremo Simon Fuller, described her as the "next Christina Aguilera" but the hype didn't quite materialise.</p><p>In 2007, Jo appeared in Celebrity Big Brother, where she was accused of ganging up on the Indian actress Shilpa Shetty with Jade Goody and Danielle Lloyd.</p><p>The following year she was struck by a bottle on stage while performing with S Club co-stars Bradley and Paul in Bradford and had to be rushed to hospital.</p><p>Her son Lenny, now 14, with ex Bill Slater was born the same year.</p><p>Recently the singer has been blighted by health issues, waking up in December in&nbsp;so much pain&nbsp;that she felt like she had been shot.</p><p>She spent eight days in hospital, where ­surgeons removed part of a disc in her back.</p><p>Since releasing her&nbsp;<a href=#>second solo album With Love</a>&nbsp;in 2021, Jo has had a busy schedule of solo concerts which she hopes to resume.</p><h2><strong>Bradley McIntosh</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/COMP_LY_Bradley-SCLUB7.jpg><p>South Londoner Bradley has remained one of the core members of&nbsp; the Reach For The Stars merchants - soldiering on in recent years as S Club 3.</p><p>He also formed boyband Upper Street with Dane Bowers, Jimmy Constable from 911, and a few other former stars.</p><p>In 2008, the 41-year-old launched a solo career under the name City Boy, releasing the single No Regret, and penned tracks for JLS.</p><p>The singer still performs as S Club Allstars alongside former bandmate Tina and S Club Juniors star Stacey Franks, and has a son called Kairo, who was born in 2017.</p><h2>Hannah Spearritt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/COMP_LY_HANNAH-SCLUB7-2.jpg><p>Hannah, a budding actor before S Club, went on to enjoy a film career when the band folded, appearing in Agent Cody Banks 2 and one of the terrifying Chucky movies.</p><p>She later appeared in Primeval, ITV's glossy dinosaur series, where she met and dated co-star Andrew Potts-Lee after splitting from S Club co-star Paul, whom she'd dated for five years.</p><p>In 2013 she underwent cosmetic surgery on her chest, which led to three years of hell and left her with depression and severe&nbsp;anxiety.</p><p>She became so ill that at one point she thought she was going to die.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000642813850.jpg><p>Hannah had her&nbsp;implants&nbsp;removed in 2016 and last year discussed the experience in&nbsp;ITVBe&nbsp;documentary, Hannah Spearritt: Me & Breast Implants.</p><p>She told The Sun it had been the "most traumatic three years" of her life.</p><p>After the S Club reunion tour in 2015 Hannah joined Casualty as Mercedes Christie, then EastEnders as Karen Taylor's little sister Kandice.</p><p>Hannah, 41, now has two children, Tora and Taya, with her nutritionist partner Adam Thomas.</p><p>Last month Hannah revealed she, Adam and their girls had to live in a pal's office over Christmas after they were asked to pay a “crazy” £6,000 up front for a short-term rental.</p><p>They have now been in four temporary homes in the last six months, and are still without one of their own.</p><p>To add to the agony, Hannah had been bedbound with an illness and the couple’s new holistic wellness cafe venture in South West London has stalled.</p><h2><strong>Jon Lee</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/COMP_LY_JON-SCLUB7.jpg><p>After S Club, Jon, now 40, went back to his musical theatre roots, playing Marius in Les Miserables among a tonne of other roles.</p><p>In 2010 he came out, telling Gay Times: "It's never needed to be a huge change that I've had to tell everyone about."</p><p>Like Paul he attempted to find love on a reality show, popping up on Dinner Date in 2018 to the surprise of a line-up of shocked singles.</p><h2>Tina Barrett</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/COMP_LY_TINA-B-SCLUB7-2.jpg><p>Now 46, Tina has kept the S Club flame alive as a trio with Bradley and Jo.</p><p>Most recently she toured in S Club Allstars with Bradley and Stacey Franks from S Club Juniors, alongside East 17 and Blazin' Squad.</p><p>In 2016 Tina had a baby with her then-boyfriend Paul Cashmore, a son who they named Roman.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>But when the tot was three-years-old, she and Hunted star Paul decided to <a href=#>go their separate ways</a> after six years together.</p><p>The beauty also recently <a href=#>shocked viewers of The Hit List</a> with her age-defying looks when she appeared alongside Bradley, with many commenting she "hadn't aged a day" since S Club fame.</p><img
