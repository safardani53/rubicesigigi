His mother’s name is Sherri Stoll, and his father’s name is Tim Stoll. Jarret’s father was a district manager at Pioneer Grain Elevators.</p><p>Jarret is the second child of his parents. He has an elder brother named Kelly Stoll and a younger sister named Ashley Stoll.&nbsp;</p><p>All of the Stoll children grew up playing hockey. Kelly Stoll was a member of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League’s Yorkton Terriers. Similarly, Ashley Stoll was a member of the University of Saskatchewan’s hockey team.</p><p>Jarret used to live with his family in the small town of Neudorf. When he was small, his mother used to take him and his siblings to the rink almost every day of the week.</p><p>Jarret started skating at the young age of 3. Likewise, at the age of 5, he started playing the organized hockey.&nbsp;</p><p>Jarret went to St. Paul’s Elementary School and Sacred Heart High School.</p><p>He won the bantam championship as a minor and later played for the Saskatoon Blazers of the Saskatchewan Midget Triple-A Hockey League. He also attended St. Joseph High School.</p><p>Jarret didn’t have a favorite NHL team as a child but instead followed the nomadic NHL career of a family friend, whom he would cheer for in any way he could.</p><p>Despite being a fan of the Edmonton Oilers during Gretzky’s tenure, Jarret and his family frequently attended Winnipeg Jets home games.</p><h2>Jarret Stoll | Career</h2><p>In his junior years, Jarret played with Kootenay Ice. He also became the team captain in the third season.&nbsp;</p><p>Jarret went through the NHL Draft process twice. Initially, he was drafted by the Calgary Flames as the 46th overall pick in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, but they were unable to come to terms.</p><p>Later in 2002–2003, Jarret re-entered the 2002 NHL Entry Draft, was drafted by the Oilers, and played for the Hamilton Bulldogs of the American Hockey League.</p><p>He skated with the Oilers in 2003-04 before joining the Edmonton Roadrunners in the AHL in the 2004-05 season.</p><p>Stoll returned to play with the Oilers in the 2005-06 season and was named one of the Oilers alternate captains in the 2007-08 season.</p><p>After that, Jarret played for the Los Angeles Kings. He also won his first Stanley Cup on June 11, 2012, with the Kings against the New Jersey Devils.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, he booked his second Stanley Cup with the Kings against the New York Rangers a few years later, on June 13, 2014.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jarret_Stoll-922x1024.jpg><p class=tdb-title-text>After that, Jarret signed a one-year contract with the New York Rangers. However, due to his low score and the team’s underperformance, he was waived by the Rangers.</p><p>Later, Jarret signed a PTO contract to attend the Columbus Blue Jackets. Sadly, he was released by the PTO.</p><h3>Is Jarret Stoll Retired?</h3><p>Jarret Stoll wandered around as a free agent looking for a team to sign him up for the 2016-2017 season. However, he could not find any willing team.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, Stoll has not played a game since 2016 and considers himself a retired player. However, he has not made any official announcement of his retirement.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jarret Stoll | Post Retirement</h2><p>When none of the teams were willing to sign Jarret, he had lots of time on his hands. He had spent most of his life playing hockey and could not stay away from it.&nbsp;</p><p>So, after playing seven NFL seasons and winning two Stanley Cups with the Kings, Jarret is now working as a Kings player development coach.&nbsp;</p><p>Jarret had always wanted to stay involved in the game and stay around the ice. So, he undoubtedly enjoys his new role as a coach and takes great pride in being around and trying to help the young players.</p><p>The retired player is also an analyst on Fox Sports West Kings broadcast. Further, he is working as a front-facing ambassador of the franchise.</p><p>In an interview, Jarret mentioned that he loved doing both the TV and his coaching job.&nbsp;</p><h2>How Did Erin Andrews And Jarret Stoll Meet?</h2><p>Jarret Stoll, a two-time Stanley Cup winner, texted his pal, NFL legend and morning TV personality <a href=# rel=noopener>Michael Strahan</a>, during the 2012 World Series, asking him to set him up with Erin Andrews.</p><p>When Michael delivered the message to Erin that Jarret wanted to take her to dinner, she was uninterested. Erin also had a hectic schedule at that time as she needed to finish her World Series coverage.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, Jarret decided to try to make a move toward Erin in person.</p><p>During the Tigers/Giants game in San Francisco, Jarret walked past two security officers and bent over a railing to get to the dugout from where Erin was reporting.</p><p>Erin was impressed by his daring attitude and decided to give him a chance.&nbsp;</p><p>After the World Series, the two went to dine in Hollywood and started dating soon after.&nbsp;</p><h3>Erin Andrews’s Marriage With Jarret Stoll</h3><p>Erin Andrews and Jarret Stoll got married on June 24, 2017, i.e., six months after getting engaged in December 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>The wedding ceremony took place in Montana and had a movielike feel to it. A wildflower field was created on the helipad, and mountains provided the perfect backdrop.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/erin-andrews-wedding.jpg><p>The setting was also surrounded by an old rusted wooden fence, which added to the rustic ambiance.</p><p>The helipad windsocks had been replaced with an E+J monogrammed flag, which flailed in the wind when guests were dropped off for the wedding.</p><p>As the bride came down the aisle, the couple’s favorite country music was played. The duo has celebrated their 6 year wedding anniversary together.&nbsp;</p><h2>Erin Andrews Husband | Jarret’s Previous Relationships</h2><p>Indeed, Jarret is now happily married to Erin Andrews.
