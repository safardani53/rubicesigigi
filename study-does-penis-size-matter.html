but any bigger and the orgasm rates drop.</p><p>In fact, men with a whopping 11-inch member got 30 per cent of women to reach climax, which is the same proportion for men with a four inch penis.</p><p>Another study asked what size women prefer in a relationship compared with a one-night stand.</p><p>Researchers found that the average length women preferred for a long-term relationship was 6.3 inches, but for one-night stands, women opted for slightly bigger penises, with a length of 6.4 inches.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>There is also girth (width) of a penis to think about - which many men with larger penises may not have.</p><p>Most men's penises are somewhere around 3.75 inches long when floppy and between five and seven inches when erect.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Doctor shares gory details of case where man FRACTURED his penis in rampant sex session</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIB2gY9wa2xno6nCpcWMnaaeq12lsq%2B10maqorKVYrqiwNOeqWg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstudy-does-penis-size-matter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fstudy-does-penis-size-matter.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fstudy-does-penis-size-matter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fstudy-does-penis-size-matter.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstudy-does-penis-size-matter.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstudy-does-penis-size-matter.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sharon-osbournes-favorite-clip-is-from-when-ozzy-was-a-concern-in-the-80s.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sharon-osbournes-favorite-clip-is-from-when-ozzy-was-a-concern-in-the-80s.html>Sharon Osbournes favorite clip is from when Ozzy was a concern in the 80s Fri</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kylie-jenner-dazzled-in-a-see-through-dress-on-25th-birthday-pic.html>Kylie Jenner Dazzled in a See-Through Dress on 25th Birthday: Pic</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kylie-jenner-dazzled-in-a-see-through-dress-on-25th-birthday-pic.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
