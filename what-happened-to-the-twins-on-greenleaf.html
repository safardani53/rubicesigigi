The show, which is currently airing its fourth season and has already been renewed for a Season 5, follows the Greenleaf family as they navigate their Memphis megachurch and the scandals that happen within it.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The show centers around the family of Bishop James Greenleaf and Lady Mae Greenleaf, and begins when their estranged daughter Grace Greenleaf returns home after 20 years following the sudden death of her sister, Faith.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But many viewers are wondering about Grace and Faith's youngest sister, the baby of the Greenleaf family, Charity (Deborah Joy Winans).</p><p>At the end of Season 1, Charity is pregnant with twins, but when we pick up at Season 2, she only has one child: a boy named Nathan.

As the baby of the family, she resents Grace for having left the family and forcing her to stay bound to her family's church (she's the Minister of Music).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She's married to Kevin Satterlee, who we meet as a devoted husband until he confesses midway through Season 1 that he's having sexual thoughts about other men.

Did I miss something?" one confused viewer took to the internet to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ask</a>.</p><p>"One of the babies died but Charity was still able to have the one," another fan explained. "I didn't know that was possible until I worked in Labor and Delivery ... Charity went to the hospital all stressed out because of what Kevin told her. They just didn't play it out for us to see what happened," they added by way of background.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Observant viewers pointed to a moment when a character says that Charity is having a C-section because one of the twins passed away in the second trimester. "The shock of finding out that her husband played for team moist sent her over the edge and she had a partial miscarriage [sic]," a fan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">added</a>. "When one twin dies, they leave the bay inside until the entire pregnancy can be safely delivered [sic]."</p><p>While Nathan is a healthy child we're getting to see grow older, we learn in Season 2 Episode 11 that his twin sister would have been named Eden Brooke had she survived.</p><p>Don't miss the chance to catch up with the Greenleaf family and their scandalous megachurch by streaming all four seasons of the show, which stars Keith David, Lyn Whitfield and Merle Dandridge, on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGStoJViwbi1zaxkqKZdnL%2Bmsc2lnJqe</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-twins-on-greenleaf.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-twins-on-greenleaf.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-twins-on-greenleaf.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-twins-on-greenleaf.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-twins-on-greenleaf.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-twins-on-greenleaf.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./micky-van-de-ven-girlfriend-who-is-he-dating-parents-family.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./micky-van-de-ven-girlfriend-who-is-he-dating-parents-family.html>Who Is He Dating?
