There is just a film of mud everywhere. It's disgusting.</p><p>"It got so bad I had to pressure wash the front of my house just to get it clean.</p><p>"And if it’s sunny, the mud dries and then just turns to dust, so you can’t have your windows open.</p><p>"The dust covers your windows, windowsills, front door – it’s horrendous."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000652926728.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000652926727.jpg><p>Work on the 400-home Coppice Heights site started earlier this year - with developer Bellway providing only a single road sweeper to clean up the dirt left by lorries as they leave.</p><p>Trucks are also blocking the road and pavement, claim residents, who face up to two more years of disruption.&nbsp;</p><p>Luke said: "This is going to be happening for at least another couple of years. It’s gutting, to be honest.</p><p>"I've been here for six years and had never thought about selling my home before, but I am now.</p><p>"The problem is, any potential buyers would probably be put off by what is going on."</p><p>Luke said he doesn't blame the lorry drivers as "they're just doing their jobs".</p><p>Instead he points the finger at Bellway, which "doesn't care about local people or the impact this is having", only "how quickly it can build homes to sell".</p><h2>'DISGUSTING'</h2><p>He added: "I understand that we need new homes, and that they have to be built somewhere, but Bellway just isn’t doing enough to lessen the effect on the local community.&nbsp;</p><p>"They say they are using a road sweeper to help, but it just cleans the area around the junction where the lorries turn in to the development every so often, then parks up again.&nbsp;</p><p>"It’s a long road that the mud is being left on – one road sweeper at the bottom is like fighting a fire with a garden hose."</p><p>And it isn't just the mud and traffic. Luke also fears for children attending the school halfway up the road.</p><p>"I’m really worried that a child is either going to be hurt or even killed. The roads are so busy, and now really slippery too," he added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/d41643b8-dc66-4258-89fd-977411e0e4e9.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000652926717.jpg><p>Another local, self-employed Kaylea Morley, 32, is also getting fed up and described the situation as "an absolute nightmare".</p><p>She said: "You wash your car and it’s dirty five minutes later. We are having to pay to wash them all the time.</p><p>"Everything is just coated in muck, it’s awful. The windows and front door are constantly filthy.</p><p>"The road sweeper doesn’t really do anything.
