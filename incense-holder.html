Incense burning has been proven to be a great source of relaxation. This is because the aroma from the incense smoke helps to reduce anxiety, stimulate the brain, and promote an overall sense of tranquility. The practice of burning incense has been in existence for centuries, which goes to show how effective it is.</p><p>So, if you’re all about spreading positive energy and tranquility, you might want to consider using incense. Whether you have been using incense for a while, or you’re a newbie at it, you need an incense holder to properly and safely hold your incense. With tons of these products on the market, it can be difficult to select the right product. However, follow the tips in this guide and you are sure to purchase a high-quality incense burner.</p><h3>What Factors Should I Keep in Mind When Purchasing an Incense Burner?</h3><h4>Design</h4><p>There are many incense burners with different types of designs. Each kind is unique, from its outer appearance and shape to the actual interior layout designed to hold different kinds of incense. The best burner for you depends on the type of incense you intend to use it for. We will go into more detail about each of the types of incense burners below:</p><p><strong>Boat incense burner</strong>: This is also known as an ash catcher and it is the most common type of incense holder. It features a design that is flat in the middle and gently curved at both ends.</p><p>This burner has small holes drilled on each end to hold stick incense. The boat-shaped incense burner may be made from aluminum, glass, stone, or wood. The wooden type is the most common for holding stick incense.</p><p><strong>Backflow incense burner</strong>: This type of incense holder is designed like a waterfall or fountain. It is aesthetically pleasing and would complement the decor of any home. This holder is made from ceramics and requires the use of special incense cones.</p><p>When these cones are lit, the smoke gently flows downwards through the backflow burner creating a picturesque illusion of a waterfall. This burner usually comes with a variety of incense cones and sticks.</p><p><strong>Combination incense burner</strong>: This type of incense holder will not restrict you to a specific form of incense. You can burn different types of incense with it, such as cones, sticks, or coils. The combination incense holders come in different materials such as; ceramic, wood, aluminum, soapstone, etc. If you want to burn different incense at the same time for a combination fragrance, these burners can come in handy.</p><p><strong>Stone/clay incense burner</strong>: These types of burners are made with clay or stone and they usually come in many attractive shapes, designs, colors, and sizes. These burners have two different-sized holes to accommodate different sizes of incense.</p><p><strong>Cone incense burner</strong>: Cone incense is made to burn completely, hence it should never be burned on a flammable surface such as wood. However, some wooden holders have a metal insert that prevents the wood from burning.</p><p>The best incense burner for cone incense is one shaped like a bowl with a wide mouth. You want it wide enough to be able to light up a cone without the risk of burning your fingers. It should also be deep enough to contain an inch of sand or ash where the cone will sit.</p><p>Preferably, a cone incense burner will not have a lid. However, if you want one with a lid, you need to go for one that is properly ventilated and has multiple perforated holes. This will protect it from overheating and will allow your cone to burn freely. If you must use a lid, ensure that you clean it often to prevent oils and resins from building up. If you don't clean it, the build-up could taint the fragrance of your incense when lit.</p><h4>Heat absorption</h4><p>It is important to understand that incense burners are designed to absorb different levels of heat. You don't want to make the mistake of buying a low heat burner for high heat incense. If you use a simple stick incense, then a wooden option like boats and coffins will be the best option because they are wide enough to catch fallen ash that is not hot enough to burn through the material.</p><p>However, if the type of incense you have or are looking to get is charcoal or cone, then you should consider buying a ceramic option that can absorb heat. The materials of these incense burners are specially constructed to withstand the heat, unlike the standard wooden options.</p><h4>Type of incense</h4><p>The best incense holder for you depends on the type of incense. There are sticks, coils, and backflow cones. If you only plan on using the stick type of incense, then a simple stick holder would do.</p><p>However, if you intend to use a backflow cone, you would need a backflow burner. A stick holder cannot support backflow cone incense. Hence, the incense you intend to use will determine the burner design you get.</p><p>You can also decide to buy an incense holder that can support all kinds of incense, that way; you would not be restricted to a certain type of incense. If you're burning incense for religious purposes, then a metal incense burner would be the most ideal.</p><h4>Safety</h4><p>This feature should not be overlooked. Don't just shop for incense burners based on aesthetics alone, you also need to consider the safety options. Some burners can get hot from the ashes of the incense, and if they don't come with some type of insulation, it could lead to a fire. Therefore, you need to consider buying an incense burner that is insulated and will not get hot easily, or purchase a hot pad to place between the burner and your table or shelf.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGipnq6ZmsRwvMSrqqimkaF6pK3RnmaippOau7SxjKGmpZyVp3w%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fincense-holder.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fincense-holder.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fincense-holder.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fincense-holder.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fincense-holder.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fincense-holder.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./zombie-takis-walmart-halloween-return-chips.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./zombie-takis-walmart-halloween-return-chips.html>Popular discontinued snack returns to Walmart just in time for 'spooky season' and leaves fans 'scre</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./beyonce-neon-green-mini-dress-photos.html>Glows In New Photos Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./beyonce-neon-green-mini-dress-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
