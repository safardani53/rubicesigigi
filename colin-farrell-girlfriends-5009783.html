After acclaimed performances in 2015’s The Lobster and 2017’s The Killing of a Sacred Deer, the Irish actor now finds himself surrounded by<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Oscar buzz</a> for his role in 2022’s The Banshees of Inisherin. Having already procured a<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Golden Globe</a> for the dramedy, Colin is poised to take over the red carpet at the remaining shows during awards season. As a cherry on top, he’s also set to star in a new HBO spinoff series of The Batman and the futuristic A24 film After Yang.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Colin-Farrell-solo-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>While it sounds like his professional life is on solid ground, it wasn’t always the case with his love life. In his younger years, Colin was the quintessential Hollywood bachelor and bad boy, frequently making headlines for his romantic trysts and hard partying. At the height of his playboy period, he was even linked to starlets like <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Angelina Jolie</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>But it appears the matinee idol is keeping a lower profile lately and perhaps focused on finding the one, as he is a romantic at heart. “I think that’s a huge thing, if you find somebody to share your days with,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Daily Beast</a>. “That’s so beautiful. I think that’s one of the most beautiful potentials that we have as human beings, and as individuals in this shared experience.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Most recently, Colin reportedly split from his girlfriend of five years,&nbsp;<strong>Kelly Macnamara</strong>, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Sun</a>. “Colin is the man of the moment in film thanks to his role in&nbsp;The Banshees Of Inisherin. He spent months working on that along with the last Batman blockbuster, where he played Penguin. Colin’s schedule took its toll on his relationship with Kelly and they quietly called it quits,” the outlet’s insider claimed on Mar. 23, 2023. “There is no bad feeling between them but upholding a romantic relationship when your work schedule is so demanding became difficult to juggle.” In prior years, the same outlet reported that he and Kelly’s schedules made their romance difficult. “My girlfriend, she travels a lot as well with work so often times we’re two ships passing in the night. But we make sure to find a port that we can, you know, rendezvous at,” he allegedly said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Let’s take a deep dive into Colin’s wild love life and see which Hollywood beauties tried to steal his heart. Keep reading to find out more, below.</p><h2>Amelia Warner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Colin-Farrell-Girlfriend-History-SS-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>While little is known about <strong>Amelia Warner,</strong> she does hold the distinction of being Colin’s only bride! The Alexander star married the former actress in a non-legally binding ceremony in 2001 during a vacation to Tahiti, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>W Magazine</a>. They split less than a year later.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Amelia, who refers to herself as a composer on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, went on to date another handsome Irish actor: <strong>Jamie Dornan</strong>. She often shares snaps of the gorgeous couple to her social media, as seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>.</p><h2>Kim Bordenave</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Colin-Farrell-Girlfriend-History-SS-embed-6.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Colin dated model <strong>Kim Bordenave</strong> for nearly two years in the early 2000s. During their romance, the pair welcomed a son, <strong>James Padraig</strong>, in 2003. Four years later, James, whom Kim often posts about to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram,</a>&nbsp;was diagnosed with Angelman syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual and developmental delay. Despite the challenges of the disease, Colin has said that James is the biggest blessing in his life. “He’s much better than I am or was,” Colin told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Today.</a> “He’s just perfect to be honest. I really hope if he’s anything of me he’s whatever the best of me is.”</p><h2>Britney Spears</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Colin-Farrell-Girlfriend-History-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>The gossip about Colin and the “Toxic” singer kicked off Colin’s bad boy image. Arriving at the premiere of 2003’s The Recruit with Britney, Colin claimed they were only friends at the time. However, rumors persisted that they were much more than just platonic. Britney, as fans know, is married to <strong>Sam Asghari</strong> now, and the pair love showing off their romance on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>.</p><h2>Angelina Jolie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Colin-Farrell-Girlfriend-History-SS-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>It was rumored that Angelina approached Colin during the filming of their 2004 movie Alexander. They were often photographed together at this time, but many argued it was only for promotions of the film. A year later, Angelina would go on to co-star with <strong>Brad Pitt</strong> in Mr. & Mrs. Smith.</p><h2>Carmen Elektra</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Colin-Farrell-Girlfriend-History-SS-embed-5.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>The hunky actor moved on from Britney and Angelina (and even a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rumored tryst</a> with<strong> Lindsay Lohan</strong>) to<strong> Carmen Electra</strong> briefly in 2006. While the hot couple hit the red carpet together a few times, their affair was quite brief and ended after only a few months.</p><h2>Lake Bell</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Colin-Farrell-Girlfriend-History-SS-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>One of the more serious relationships Colin nurtured at the beginning of his career was with actress/writer<strong> Lake Bell</strong>. After calling it off with Carmen, Colin <span>was spotted out with Lake while filming </span>Pride and Glory<span> in 2006. </span>They quickly became red carpet official, including an event supporting ASPCA in New York in 2007. Lake, now single, shares updates on her life via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>.</p><h2>Alicja Bachleda</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Colin-Farrell-Girlfriend-History-SS-embed-7.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>By 2010, Colin was involved with Polish actress <strong>Alicja Bachleda</strong>, his co-star in the film Ondine. They were together for nearly two years, before breaking up in 2010. &nbsp;In October 2009, the couple has welcomed his second son, <strong>Henry Tadeusz</strong>. The gorgeous stunner keeps her fans updated on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> as well.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“No, he’s much better than I am or was,” Farrell said wistfully when asked if he saw a lot of himself in his young son <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Today</a>&nbsp; “He’s just perfect to be honest. I really hope if he’s anything of me he’s whatever the best of me is. But, I have time to destroy him still!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8Koo6KmXZuus77EpaNmn5mnuae%2ByJ6lnatdan1xhZZxamg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcolin-farrell-girlfriends-5009783.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcolin-farrell-girlfriends-5009783.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcolin-farrell-girlfriends-5009783.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcolin-farrell-girlfriends-5009783.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcolin-farrell-girlfriends-5009783.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcolin-farrell-girlfriends-5009783.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./craig-ferguson-tattoo-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./craig-ferguson-tattoo-html.html>How Did Craig Ferguson Inspire a Show on the History Channel through His Tattoo?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tim-cooks-girlfriend-list.html>Tim Cooks Girlfriend: Who is Tim Cook Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tim-cooks-girlfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
