As Bruce always says, 'Live it up' and together we plan to do just that," his family said in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>message shared on their respective Instagram accounts</a>. The note was signed by all five of the actor's daughters, as well as Heming and Moore.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The family gave an update on Bruce's health on Feb. 16, 2023, sharing that his condition had <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>progressed into frontotemporal dementia</a>. In a statement on Instagram, Moore, Heming and his three older daughters wrote, "While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The next day, a source told PEOPLE that the actor's family "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>is all closer than ever</a>" amid news of his FTD diagnosis. The insider added that Heming "is trying to make as many positive memories" for their daughters Mabel and Evelyn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She wants them to remember Bruce as an amazing, fun dad. She wants them to have the best memories of him," they added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bruce's children have continued to rally around him since his health announcement. In December 2022, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>entire blended family got together for dinner</a>, as seen in photos posted by Moore on Instagram. "We are FAMILY!! Getting into the holiday spirit!" she captioned a snap of her and Bruce smiling with their three daughters, Rumer, Scout and Tallulah, along with Heming, Evelyn and Mabel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That same month, Bruce's eldest daughter announced <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>she was expecting</a> her first child. A source told PEOPLE that the retired actor was looking forward to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>meeting his first grandchild</a>. "He is happy about becoming a grandpa," the insider said. "He loves having a big family. They are all spending Christmas together."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Bruce is enjoying not working and having more family time. He likes being around his girls more," they added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On March 19, 2023, Bruce turned 68 years old, and Heming celebrated by sharing a video tribute to her husband on Instagram. The clip featured many <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sweet moments between Bruce and his two youngest daughters</a>, Mabel and Evelyn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rumer gave birth to her daughter, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Louetta Isley Thomas Willis</a>, on April 18, 2023. The actress and her boyfriend, Derek Richard Thomas, introduced their little bundle of joy to the world on Instagram.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Omg we love her so so much 😍😍😍😍," Heming commented on a sweet photo of the newborn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Three months later, Heming celebrated the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>35th anniversary of the Die Hard premiere</a> by sharing a video of Mabel and Evelyn on the Fox Studio lot.

The couple chose to raise Rumer outside of Hollywood, with the little girl spending much of her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>childhood in Hailey, Idaho</a>, where the family purchased a $2.5 million mansion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although Rumer was raised in a small town, she still got a taste of life in the spotlight at a young age. When she was just five, she made <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>her onscreen debut</a> in her mom's coming-of-age film Now and Then — but was credited under the name Willa Glen. A few years later, she appeared on the big screen again in Striptease, where she portrayed Moore's onscreen daughter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Growing up, Rumer continued to periodically appear in films, including Bruce's The Whole Nine Yards and Hostage. As a high schooler, she moved to Los Angeles, where she attended Wildwood Secondary School. She befriended <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>other famous celebrity offspring</a> like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Riley Keough</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Dakota Johnson</a>, but says after moving to the west coast, she began to experience <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>intense scrutiny about her appearance</a> that she hadn't previously faced while living in a small town.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They said I had a huge jaw. They said I had a ′potato head.' When you're 14 or 15, I didn't really understand having value in myself yet. My mind went to, 'Okay, so if I get skinny or if I dress the right way or present myself very hyper-sexually and dress this way, then I'll be valued,' " Rumer shared. "So much for me became wrapped up in that my value set is based on what other people think of me, and had nothing to do with what I thought about myself."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rumer sought to take some time away from the spotlight when she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>enrolled at the University of Southern California</a> in 2006. She only attended USC <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>for one</a> semester before dropping out after deciding to pursue a career in the entertainment industry. She then appeared in films like The House Bunny, From Within and Sorority Row. She even took home the award for Breakthrough Performance at the Young Hollywood Awards for her appearance in the high school comedy Wild Cherry.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since those early days of her acting career, Rumer has appeared in numerous other films, including There's Always Woodstock, Hello Again and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, as well as TV series like The Secret Life of the American Teenager, Pretty Little Liars and Empire. She's also participated in quite a few reality shows like The Masked Singer and Dancing with the Stars, where she was crowned champion alongside her partner <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Valentin Chmerkovskiy</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rumer has also pursued her love of music throughout her career, appearing on Broadway as Roxie Hart in a 2015 production of Chicago and singing as part of her role on Empire.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2017, Rumer opened up about her decision to get sober, although she later clarified that her choice <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>had nothing to do with substance abuse</a>. She explained that she had originally decided to take part in "sober January" and then realized it was something she didn't want to stop.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now at 35, Rumer continues to be close with her parents, spending much of the pandemic <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>quarantining with her family</a>. In July 2022, she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>posed in an Andie swim campaign alongside Moore</a> and two of her sisters.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In December 2022, Rumer and her boyfriend, Derek Richard Thomas, announced they were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>expecting their first child</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Entering my <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hot kooky unhinged grandma era</a>," Moore wrote on Instagram in response to the big news.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In April 2023, Rumer told PEOPLE she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hopes her unborn baby has Bruce and Moore's "goofiness."</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We're a family of weirdos, and I love that so much.

"That's my favorite thing, laughing with my family."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rumer added that she planned to give birth "unmedicated" like her mom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Empire actress did just that on April 18, 2023. During a home birth, Rumer welcomed her daughter, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Louetta Isley Thomas Willis</a>, into the world.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You are pure magic.

The actress included a picture of herself breastfeeding her baby girl plus a lengthy caption in which she recalled being pregnant on her birthday the year before.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was nervous and excited and felt so many tiny little butterflies in my belly and in deep wondering of who this little soul may be," she wrote.

Ortega/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The former couple's second daughter, Scout LaRue Willis, was born on July 20, 1991, in Sun Valley, Idaho, close to where the family had settled down with Rumer. Like her sister, Scout spent her younger years out of the spotlight, although she did appear in Moore's 1995 film The Scarlet Letter and Bruce's 1999 film Breakfast of Champions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a teenager, Scout moved to L.A. with her family and later enrolled at Brown University. After graduating in 2013, Scout turned her attention to more artistic endeavors. She took part <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>in a London exhibition</a> that featured her self-portraits and later <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>shared topless photos of herself</a> as a commentary on body politics and Instagram's censorship of women. As part of her effort to start a discussion, she walked around New York City topless — pointing out that it was legal to do so while Instagram's rules censored nudity.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Scout Willis Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As of late, Scout has been focusing her attention on music — which conveys similar themes to her art. While she did release an EP in 2012 as part of the duo Gus + Scout, she didn't decide to wholeheartedly pursue music for another decade. After teaching herself to play guitar in 2016, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>she released her debut single</a>, "Love Without Possession," in 2021. The following year, she released "Woman at Best," which she called an "ode to feminine creativity, sexuality and freedom." In June 2022, she released her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>self-titled full-length album</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Scout's Instagram is mainly full of photos of her artwork and promotions for her music career, she did share a rare family <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>photo</a> in July 2021 in honor of her 30th birthday. "30 years ago today the V* rare 2 of 3 DemiXBruce collab dropped," she captioned a snap of her smiling with Bruce and Moore.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tallulah-belle-willis-29></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Tallulah Belle Willis, 29</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Tallulah Willis Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bruce and Moore welcomed their youngest child, Tallulah Belle Willis, on Feb. 3, 1994, in L.A. Like her older sisters, she spent her early years on the family's ranch in Idaho. Thanks to her small-town upbringing, Tallulah was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>completely unaware of the full extent</a> of her family's fame until they moved to California when she was in the third grade, as she told Teen Vogue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-92 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tallulah struggled with living life in the spotlight as a teenager, telling told Teen Vogue that by the time she turned 13, she had become her own worst critic. Reading comments about her appearance online only heightened her insecurities, and it eventually triggered an eating disorder.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By the time she was in college, "the depression became overwhelming" and she was regularly using drugs, as she explained to the outlet. Her sisters encouraged her to get help, and not long after, Tallulah voluntarily entered a treatment center. Looking back on that time, Tallulah shared that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>becoming sober was "the most important thing"</a> she'd ever done and she was forever grateful to the "powerful human beings" who "hoisted" her from her hole.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-96 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following her stay in rehab, Tallulah repaired her strained relationship with her family. In 2019, she joined Moore and Rumer on an episode of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Red Table Talk</a>, and admitted she was still <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>getting to know her "intimidating" mother</a>. Tallulah explained that Moore had always held back and refrained from sharing her past, making her "feel very far away from her." But after reading Moore's memoir, she got to know her mom on a different level and realized they were more alike than she thought.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-98 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Tallulah Willis Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tallulah is now focused on forging a career in the fashion industry, and she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>launched her own clothing brand</a>, Wyllis, during the pandemic. The line, which includes pieces that feature Tallulah's art, works to promote mental health awareness and self-empowerment. Tallulah told PEOPLE that she hopes Wyllis will become "synonymous with safety, with awareness, with sensitivity, with kindness."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-101 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Basically my dream is to have wild success with my clothing line, heal the world with mental health and then move somewhere on a ranch and get 15 dogs of all shapes and sizes. And just be a Willy Wonka sort of like hounds," Tallulah shared.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-105 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following Bruce's frontotemporal dementia diagnosis, Tallulah <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>opened up about her father's declining health</a> in a first-person piece for&nbsp;Vogue,&nbsp;published in May 2023. “I’ve known that something was wrong for a long time,” she wrote. “It started out with a kind of vague unresponsiveness."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-107 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tallulah also admitted that she reacted to her father’s health decline with “avoidance and denial” amid her own struggles with an eating disorder and borderline personality disorder.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-109 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was at a wedding in the summer of 2021 on Martha’s Vineyard, and the bride’s father made a moving speech. Suddenly <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>I realized that I&nbsp;would never get that moment</a>, my dad speaking about me in adulthood at my wedding," she wrote, describing the very instance that Bruce's diagnosis became "painfully" real. "It was devastating. I left the dinner table, stepped outside, and wept in the bushes."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mabel-ray-willis-11></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-111 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Mabel Ray Willis, 11</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-112 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emma Heming Willis Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-113 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On April 1, 2012, Bruce and Heming <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>welcomed their first child together</a> — a baby girl named Mabel Ray Willis.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-115 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although Mabel was born in L.A., the family spent her first few years living at their home in Bedford Hills, New York — about an hour outside of New York City. Heming explained that she wanted a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>peaceful life for their family</a>, away from the paparazzi and the culture of Hollywood.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-117 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We wanted our kids to be able to have more room and a yard to run in. I also wanted to keep the kids as sheltered as we could from the paparazzi, and that scene is still very prevalent in L.A.; it's not bad in New York, and it's zero up where we live. The beauty of where we live is that it's close to the city, so we get the best of both worlds," Heming told Elle Décor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-119 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It appears Mabel has gotten the best of both worlds, as evidenced by Heming's Instagram. While some days are spent <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>playing in the backyard</a> and performing in piano recitals, others involve trips to N.Y.C. for bowling nights and attending <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Broadway shows</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-121 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These days, Mabel is in elementary school and says that one day she hopes to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>become a "shark" on Shark Tank</a>. When she's not in school, she loves spending time with her parents and older sisters — and even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>gives her dad a dance lesson</a> every once in a while!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-evelyn-penn-willis-9></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-123 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Evelyn Penn Willis, 9</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-124 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Bruce Willis with wife Emma Heming Willis and their daughters.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emma Heming Willis Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-125 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple grew their family once more with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the birth of their younger daughter</a>, Evelyn Penn Willis, born on May 5, 2014. Shortly after her birth, a rep for the couple said both Heming and Evelyn were "healthy and doing beautifully" and that Mabel was "delighted to have a new baby sister."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-127 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"[We] didn't know <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>what we were gonna have</a> until the baby came out. In general, I think women should be in charge of everything. Women are just much smarter than men," Bruce told PEOPLE a week after Mabel's arrival.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-129 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With the addition of another baby to the family, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Heming shared that their home</a> was "filled with joy and the laughter and chatter of little girls being themselves" in a place they "created with them in mind."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-131 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emma Heming Willis Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-132 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As she's gotten older, Heming has shared lots of photos of the little girl, showing off her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>love of Star Wars</a>, her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>foray into sewing</a> and her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>appreciation for roller coasters</a>. During the pandemic, she also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>learned how to ride a bike</a> while quarantining with her entire family, including Moore and her half-sisters, who cheered her on when she ditched her training wheels.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-134 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Bruce was diagnosed with dementia, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Evelyn did her part to care for her father</a>. In a May 2023 Instagram post, Heming shared that their youngest researched "fun facts about dementia" and learned that&nbsp;those with the disease "can become severely dehydrated."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-136 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Heming continued, "So I said to her, 'Evelyn, we will always make sure daddy has a bottle of water in hand. Thank you for letting me know. But that is the most loving and compassionate thing that you can do is to be curious and educate yourself on your dad's disease.'
