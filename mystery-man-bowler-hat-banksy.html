I have a couple of&nbsp;Banksy&nbsp;prints but not originals.</p><p>"To see a piece that had freshly come off a building was pretty cool. It was like the holy grail coming out of a skip."</p><p>Workmen at the site said they "felt sick" after finding out the stencilled image at Blacksole Farm - which has been earmarked for 67 homes - was a genuine&nbsp;Banksy.</p><p>Now,&nbsp;Banksy&nbsp;expert John Brandler has said he would "love to restore" the piece and display it in Dover museum.</p><p>He said: "We can restore this. This isn't a major disaster if we are given access to the property and can sort it out."</p><p>Mr Brandler could not say how much the destroyed art could be worth, but that it would "depend on how much is salvageable, how much can be restored and how much would be original".</p><p>He added: "To rebuild it, what we would do is get the two sheets of metal, we'd get the surface it was painted on and the surrounding bricks to create the original picture.</p><p>"We would then mount it on a backing material so it doesn't fall apart."</p><h3>The elusive artist's identity is unknown</h3><p>Despite the excitement, someone who claims to know the famous artist has claimed pictures of the strange man aren't of Banksy.</p><p>The elusive graffiti artist's identity has never been officially confirmed.</p><p>In 2003 a journalist who met the then 28-year-old artist, described him as "white, scruffy casual - jeans, T-shirt, a silver tooth, silver chain and silver earring".</p><p>He looks like a cross between Jimmy Nail, from Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, and Mike Skinner of The Streets, the journalist claimed.</p><p>Some five years later a picture emerged of a man in Jamaica who was said to be&nbsp;Banksy.</p><p>The photograph was allegedly of Robin Gunningham, who grew up in Bristol.</p><p>Other reports suggested Banksy is artist and musician Robert del Naja of Massive Attack, who is also a graffiti artist and member of the Bristol collective the Wild Bunch.</p><p>In 2020, <a href=#>Art Attack presenter Neil Buchanan was forced to deny a bizarre conspiracy theory that he was&nbsp;Banksy</a>.</p><p>'Morning Has Broken' was the fourth&nbsp;Banksy&nbsp;piece in Kent.</p><p>The third was a woman in 50s-era dress painted on the side of a home in nearby Margate, called <a href=#>Valentine's Day Mascara</a>.</p><p>It will be relocated to Dreamland on the seaside town's promenade.</p><p>The artist <a href=#>created a giant Brexit mural in Dover, but it was mysteriously whitewashed in 2019</a>.</p><p>There are now plans for it to be recreated when the building is redeveloped.</p><p>Banksy's first w<a href=#>ork in the county was a piece called Art Buff in Folkestone</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>That was also removed and sent to America where it went up for auction but failed to sell.</p><p>It is now back in the town and on display in the Old High Street.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/banksy-instagram-pa-wire-note-803252887.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/banksy-instagram-pa-wire-note-803252910.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/89ad8cf3-ee23-4a00-9f3b-fa5dc94ffde3.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ354g5NpaHFnna7AtbHRsmSmmZ5ir7DDy56pZqCRqXqjrc2kqrJn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmystery-man-bowler-hat-banksy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmystery-man-bowler-hat-banksy.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmystery-man-bowler-hat-banksy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmystery-man-bowler-hat-banksy.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmystery-man-bowler-hat-banksy.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmystery-man-bowler-hat-banksy.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./larry-black.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./larry-black.html>Larry Black (American football)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./guy-bensons-girlfriend-list.html>Guy Bensons Girlfriend: Who is Guy Benson Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./guy-bensons-girlfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
