Someone had claimed bankruptcy in his name while he was chartering at sea.</p><p>Captain Lee told Bravo’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Daily Dish</a>: “I was at sea so it was just like I’m getting all these emails and phone calls, and my phone’s blowing up. They said, ‘Your bankruptcy. We had no idea.’ I said, ‘What bankruptcy?’ I said, ‘I’m not bankrupt. I don’t owe anybody.’”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-captain-lee-s-son-tragically-passed-away>Captain Lee’s son tragically passed away</h2><p>Captain Lee’s youngest son, Joshua Lee Rosback, tragically passed away at the age of 42 in 2019. Lee shared that his son had fought a 20-year battle with addiction.</p><p>Joshua’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">obituary</a> stated he passed “in the comfort of his home,” while he shared his father’s love of the ocean whether “sailboating or first mate aboard a yacht.”</p><p>Captain Lee told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> he thought Josh had turned a corner as he had got himself a car, job and was “doing well.” Sadly, Captain Lee told Instagram followers: “Addiction is an insidious disease.” He added that no matter someone’s social class or geographic boundaries, the “devastation it leaves remains the same.”</p><p>He added in a moving caption: “We loved Josh unconditionally and were proud of the man he had become in spite of his problems. There was no one I ever knew who gave more of himself to those in his life. He loved with all his being without expecting anything in return. We both feel a hole in our souls that will never be filled.”</p><p>Captain Lee concluded his Instagram post by urging those fighting addiction to “get help no matter what.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Captain Lee Rosbach (@captain_lee_rosbach)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=captain-lee-gets-loving-tattoo-in-tribute-to-lost-son>Captain Lee gets loving tattoo in tribute to lost son</h2><p>Since his son’s passing, Captain Lee has spoken candidly on the show about the effects it has had on himself and his family.</p><p>Fans flooded the comments section of his Instagram tribute including former Below Deck chief stew Kate Chastain, who took to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a> to share a heartfelt message.</p><p>On the one-year anniversary of Joshua’s passing, Captain Lee got a beautiful tattoo of his son’s face, as per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Distractify.</a> The tattoo was across his heart, where his son belongs.</p><p>Captain Lee also changed Mary Anne’s wedding ring to have a heart that reads “Josh” – it also holds some of their late son’s ashes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Captain Lee Rosbach (@captain_lee_rosbach)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=captain-lee-leaves-below-deck-a-season-early>Captain Lee leaves Below Deck a season early</h2><p>The 73-year-old great-grandfather has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">struggled </a>to overcome ongoing health issues so decided to leave Below Deck early. The reality star announced his exit on the most recent episode of Below Deck, which aired on Monday, December 19, 2022.</p><p>His health issues mean he needs to sit out the show to focus on himself as he fears his health concerns might have an effect on the whole boat. This season, he has been captaining the Motoryacht St David, which is sailing in St Lucia.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4>Lee was struggling with nerve issues at the start of season 10 but continued with the charter season hoping his injury would subside. However, he admitted: “My injury, it’s getting worse. The left side of my body, I don’t feel anything. I expected a lot more progress than I’m experiencing and,the most frustrating part about it is, I can’t do a thing about it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8>The premature end of his yachting season saw him call a team meeting as he told the crew: “As you guys know I’ve been struggling with my mobility. It’s been hard, and I’ve let you guys down, and for that, I apologize. So I’ve made a decision to leave the boat.”</p><p>Rosbach’s bombshell left fans distraught as the anchor of the series was dropped. Don’t count on him not returning, though. Thankfully, he doesn’t plan to retire just yet.</p><p><strong>If you’ve been affected by this story you can contact American Addiction Centers on (877) 686-7688 or Talk To Frank on 0300 123 6600 in the UK.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfm7KiwNSrnKxnpKeuqLHDopysZZOWvbWtyKdkpZ2VYrWiv4yfmJydlGKvprjOsGSdnZOgeqK6w2aYsJmpYrOzu8xmq6GdXZiurrHRmqo%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftragedies-captain-lee-has-faced-below-deck-and-away-from-the-cameras.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftragedies-captain-lee-has-faced-below-deck-and-away-from-the-cameras.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftragedies-captain-lee-has-faced-below-deck-and-away-from-the-cameras.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftragedies-captain-lee-has-faced-below-deck-and-away-from-the-cameras.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftragedies-captain-lee-has-faced-below-deck-and-away-from-the-cameras.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftragedies-captain-lee-has-faced-below-deck-and-away-from-the-cameras.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bretman-rock-new-tattoo-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bretman-rock-new-tattoo-html.html>Bretman Rock Gets New Playboy Bunny Tattoo after Making History</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./zac-efron-bungee-jumping-brother-dylan-shirtless-abs-video.html>Zac Efron Goes Bungee Jumping With His Brother Dylan While Shirtless Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./zac-efron-bungee-jumping-brother-dylan-shirtless-abs-video.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
