The Dutch defender has kept his social media handle limited to his soccer achievements.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Though he might not have shared romantic snaps, we can’t fully confirm that the Spurs’ latest signing is single.

The defender saw his side beat the Ukrainian team Shakhtar Donetsk with ease as <a href=# rel=noopener>Harry Kane</a> slotted four goals.&nbsp;</p><p>The former Wolfsburg is one of many signings made by Spurs in this summer transfer window. On Tuesday, the London club announced the signing of the young striker Alejo Veliz alongside Micky.</p><p>The former Leicester City player <a href=# rel=noopener>James Maddison</a> also joined Spurs earlier this transfer window alongside Pedro Porro, Guglielmo Vicario, Manor Solomon, and Ashley Philips.&nbsp;</p><h2>Micky van de Ven Girlfriend: Who Is He Dating?</h2><p>Micky van de Ven hasn’t revealed any details about his girlfriend. On Instagram, there isn’t a single post the soccer player has shared that could hint at his romantic life.</p><p>But on August 6, as Tottenham Hotspur played Shakhtar Donetsk, Micky was present in the stands. The new Spurs player even clicked a few pictures with fans from the stands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/micky-van-de-ven-spurs.jpg><p>In a few of the pictures and videos taken by fans, a woman is seen sitting next to the defender. Some believe the lady is Micky’s girlfriend, with whom he is yet to become Instagram official.&nbsp;</p><p>A clear view of the alleged couple can be seen in a video uploaded by one of the fans on <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok</a>. In the video, the lady shows her returning the pen to a fan after Micky signed his merch.&nbsp;</p><p>Micky has already become a fan favorite among Spurs fans since the rumors circulated of him joining the London club. With defense being one of the main issues of Spurs last season, fans are looking forward to seeing Micky make a quick impact on their side.&nbsp;</p><h2>Micky van de Ven Parents, Father Marcel van de Ven Is An Author</h2><p>Micky van de Ven’s parents, Marcel and Bianca, raised him in Wormer, Netherlands.
