<time>09 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>JJ Reddick</strong> immediately comes to mind when we talk about one of the best 3-point shooters in the NBA. The 14-year NBA veteran has played for several teams throughout his illustrious career, excelling for each one. But we’re not here to talk about JJ. Instead, we’re here to talk about his lovely wife, Chelsea Kilgore.<br>Chelsea, unlike most WAGS, is an independent, successful woman who earns hundreds of thousands of dollars as a Pilates and fitness instructor.</p><p>So, let’s get started on this article about JJ’s better half, Kilgore, where we’ll tell you about his personal and professional life.</p><h2>Quick Facts</h2><table class=table><tbody><tr><th>Full Name</th><td><strong>Chelsea Kilgore</strong></td></tr><tr><th>Date of Birth</th><td>May 12, 1987</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Place</th><td>Mississippi, U.S.A</td></tr><tr><th>Marital Status</th><td>Married</td></tr><tr><th>Spouse</th><td>JJ Reddick</td></tr><tr><th>Religion</th><td>Christian</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality</th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th>Age</th><td>36 Years Old</td></tr><tr><th>Profession</th><td>Pilates & Fitness Instructor</td></tr><tr><th>Height</th><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><th>Kids</th><td>Kai Reddick, Knox Reddick</td></tr><tr><th>Weight</th><td>6 feet 3 inches (1.90 m)</td></tr><tr><th>Salary</th><td><span class=info title data-original-title>$200k – $450k per year</span></td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth</th><td>$2 million</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Chelsea Kilgore Biography</h2><p><strong>Chelsea Kilgore</strong> was born to Robin Kilgore and her husband, John Kilgore. Furthermore, she was born on May 12, 1987, in Mississippi. She was not, however, the only child born to her parents that day.</p><p>We know this because Chelsea has a twin sister named Kylee Jean. Kylee is currently employed as a Public Relations officer. After graduating from Canton Public School, the twins attended Mississippi State University.</p><p>Chelsea majored in elementary education and taught there. However, the 36-year-old later fell in love with fitness and became certified as a Pilates instructor.</p><h2>Chelsea Kilgore Age, Height And Weight</h2><p>This Pilates and fitness instructor is currently 36 years old. Chelsea, on the other hand, appears to be in her early twenties based on her appearance and athleticism. As a result, it is a testament to her long-term Pilates and fitness routine.</p><p>Unfortunately, despite hours of searching, we were unable to locate information about her body measurements. However, given that she is a fitness instructor, we are confident that Kilgore is in excellent health. Nonetheless, stay tuned because we will update this piece as soon as the details are released.</p><p>Moving on, Chelsea celebrates her birthday on May 12th. As a result, her horoscope indicates that she is born under the sign of Taurus.</p><p>Taurus is ruled by Venus, so they share some of her characteristics, such as beauty, artistry, and a love of luxury, to name a few.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Chelsea-Kilgor-1.jpg><h2>Career</h2><p>Chelsea’s professional life is not as interesting as her husband’s. To clarify, Kilgore spends the majority of her time working as a Pilates and fitness instructor. Moreover, unlike most other WAGS, she prefers to care for her children herself rather than hire a nanny.</p><p>As a result, Reddick is one lucky man to have Chelsea as a wife. Aside from that, the 33-year-old is an important part of her husband’s foundation, JJ Reddick Foundation Inc., which assists young underprivileged children in improving their lives.</p><p>Reddick, the father of her children, on the other hand, is a professional basketball player who has been in the NBA for over 14 years. If you’re a fan of the NBA, I’m sure you’ve heard about JJ’s 3-point shooting prowess.</p><p>Furthermore, JJ rose to prominence while playing for the Los Angeles Clippers. During his time with the Clippers, Reddick worked well with All-Stars such as Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, and Deandre Jordan.</p><p>He then joined the Philadelphia 76ers, where he had some of his best moments. Reddick, among other things, helped his team reach the 2019 NBA Eastern Conference finals. However, they were defeated by the eventual NBA champions, the Toronto Raptors.</p><p>JJ currently has a two-year contract with the New Orleans Pelicans. Furthermore, New Orleans recently drafted Zion Williamson, the hottest young talent to come after the GOAT LeBron James. As a result, we would like to wish Reddick the best of luck as he embarks on a new chapter in his life.</p><h2>Chelsea Kilgore’s Net Worth</h2><p>Chelsea has a net worth of $2 million as of September 2023. The 36-year-enormous old’s net worth stems from her work as a professional Pilates and fitness instructor. Furthermore, Kilgore’s annual salary ranges from $200,000 to $450,000.</p><p>Although Kilgore is extremely wealthy on her own, her husband’s net worth is simply astounding. To clarify, Reddick, who plays for the New Orleans Saints in the NBA, has a whopping $35 million in net worth.</p><p>Furthermore, JJ has earned more than $104 million in salary during his 14-year NBA career. In terms of pay, Reddick is making $13.4 million this season with the Saints.</p><h2>Chelsea Kilgore Husband, Marriage</h2><p>When it comes to Chelsea’s love life, we all know she is married to her husband, NBA player JJ Reddick. The couple met in 2008, but both have declined to elaborate on the details of their relationship’s beginning.</p><p>Nonetheless, after a year of dating, the two lovers decided to marry in 2009. Since then, the two have had nothing but love and respect for one another. They have two children, Knox Reddick and Kai Reddick.</p><p>Knox, the elder sibling, was born in August 2014, while Kai, the younger sibling, was born two years later in August 2016. And, speaking of now, the two’s romance has never been stronger.</p><p>To emphasize, JJ frequently posts photos of his wife and two children on his Instagram account. As a result, we believe that this couple will be together for the rest of their lives.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaoZ2cqLKiecqio6Cnopp8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchelsea-kilgore.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchelsea-kilgore.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchelsea-kilgore.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchelsea-kilgore.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchelsea-kilgore.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchelsea-kilgore.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./steve-harvey-sneakily-selling-off-assets-ahead-of-divorce-battle.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./steve-harvey-sneakily-selling-off-assets-ahead-of-divorce-battle.html>Sneakily Selling Off Assets Ahead of Divorce Battle?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./brooke-hyland.html>Brooke Hyland Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./brooke-hyland.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
