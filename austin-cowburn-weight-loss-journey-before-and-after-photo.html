<time>13 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>After accumulating a lot of weight and feeling lethargic, former athlete Austin Cowburn shed 54 pounds in six months. Here’s how he accomplished his aim. You’ve probably heard the saying, “Our goal should not be to become better than other people, but better than our previous selves.” Setting goals is becoming simpler and more popular. However, just a few individuals are able to do so. One of them is Austin Cowburn.</p><p>Austin Cowburn is a marathon runner. The former runner lost 54 pounds in six months because of his consistent hard work and devotion. His accomplishment takes everyone aback. More significantly, he has established himself as a role model for people seeking to reduce weight. So, in today’s piece, we’ll look at how the runner met his objective, as well as his diet and fitness routine.</p><h2>Before and After Austin Cowburn Weight Loss; Did the Former Runner Lose 54 Pounds in 6 Months?</h2><p>Running has always been Austin Cowburn’s preferred form of exercise. As a consequence, he was a member of various running groups and performed well in the 1995 New York Marathon. He spent his weeknights and Saturday mornings in the pool or on the track. The runner told Men’s Health that cardio is known to him, but as he got older, he remained with it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Austin-Cowburn-1.jpg><p>In retrospect, he understood there was a lack of knowledge and technique to reap the benefits of weight training. Austin was in a rut after a few years of aimless exercise and a terrible diet. He even had two injuries and recuperation, which resulted in his gaining a lot of weight. These aggravated other minor ailments, giving him the impression that he wasn’t in top form.&nbsp;His favorite shirt didn’t fit since he was tired. Cowburn also wants to get back into marathon running. However, he was far from meeting the marathon qualifying criterion at the time.</p><p>He needed to become considerably stronger, fitter, and healthier. As a result, he called Ultimate Performance personal trainers in Manchester and began with the fundamentals, such as food monitoring and consistency.&nbsp;For six months, the runner followed his trainer’s strategy and developed his best self.</p><h2>&nbsp;Austin Cowburn Diet Plan</h2><p>Austin Cowburn’s breakfast would consist of a berry smoothie with protein. He ate three scrambled eggs with spinach in the middle of the morning.&nbsp;He’d have lean-meat chili, mainly turkey mince, with various veggies and rice in the afternoon and evening. Peppers, tomatoes, and other vegetables were among the vegetables.</p><p>Furthermore, he relished having a low-fat, high-protein yogurt combined with banana, honey, or chia seeds in the evening. Every weekend, he also ate a beautiful steak.&nbsp;According to the runner, our nutrition has the greatest influence on our attitude, energy levels, and capacity to train hard and get the most out of ourselves. He went on to say that “changing what I ate reminded me of the importance of a foundational diet.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Austin-Cowburn-2.jpg alt="Austin Cowburn" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>&nbsp;Austin Cowburn Workout Routine</h2><p>Austin Cowburn’s new self is the product of a healthy diet and structured exercise. He went to the gym three times a week from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.&nbsp;His morning workout prepared him for the day, and he enjoyed doing it first thing in the morning. Austin not only worked out three times a week, but he also ran four times a week, which rekindled his love of running.</p><p>His distances gradually grew with no problems, and there was no soreness after working out and jogging. Austin praised his ease of motion while exercising, decreasing weight, and properly nourishing his body.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYrquknrtur86wma6qnmLEprXGoatmpJ%2BowG62zq6pp52pYq%2Bmss6rnGaZnpl6orLTnqlmqJikwbB7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2faustin-cowburn-weight-loss-journey-before-and-after-photo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2faustin-cowburn-weight-loss-journey-before-and-after-photo.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2faustin-cowburn-weight-loss-journey-before-and-after-photo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2faustin-cowburn-weight-loss-journey-before-and-after-photo.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2faustin-cowburn-weight-loss-journey-before-and-after-photo.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2faustin-cowburn-weight-loss-journey-before-and-after-photo.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./pete-davidson-brooklyn-penthouse-apartment-dumbo.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./pete-davidson-brooklyn-penthouse-apartment-dumbo.html>Pete Davidson quietly moves into massive '$30K-a-month' Brooklyn loft with stunning city views &amp;amp; nei</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./adidas-predator-history.html>Adidas Predator: The history of the iconic boot as German brand releases fifteenth permanent edition</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./adidas-predator-history.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
