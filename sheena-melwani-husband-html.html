They all wanted to know who The Real Indian Dad was and, of course, what he looked like.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>During an episode of their YouTube series Asinine Advice,&nbsp;Melwani and her husband were posed the same question.</p><p>A fan asked, "Why always the cartoon face? Surely you're a handsome fellow."&nbsp;</p><p>Melwani actively dodged the question by complaining about how fans always encouraged her husband by saying such nice things about him. Thankfully, they weren't the only fan bothered by this question.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The subsequent question was, "When can we see your real face?"</p><p>This time around, there was no avoiding the question. Having noticed this, the husband announced that he would be showing his face once their YouTube channel got a million followers.&nbsp;</p><h2>A User Supposedly revealed&nbsp;The Real Indian Dad's Face</h2><p>Apparently, this was not the first time the social media stars announced this, or so a fan claimed.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>Back in February 2022, a user named&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@huntyfay&nbsp;claimed</a> that&nbsp;Melwani and her husband were supposed to do the face reveal video once they hit a million followers on TikTok.</p><p>However, the creator duo supposedly&nbsp;carried over the milestone to YouTube.</p><p>The user went on to post a video of&nbsp;Melwani and her husband alongside a slideshow of close-up portraits. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This further implied that the man being featured was what The Real Indian Dad looked like behind his virtual mask.&nbsp;</p><p>@huntyfay made the call to post the video revealing&nbsp;The Real Indian Dad's face because they were not happy with the fact that the couple changed their original clause.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><h2>The Real Indian Dad Face Reveal was Promised</h2><p>Melwani and her husband finally hit their goal of getting a million subscribers, and they executed their plan to do the face reveal.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On 21 November&nbsp;2021, the songstress put up an Instagram selfie of herself and her husband, but sadly, his face was hidden behind a bouquet.</p><p>She thanked her fans for tuning in to their channel and being with them for the crazy ride.&nbsp;</p><p>That same day, The Real Indian Dad made an announcement on his Instagram page, claiming that they were getting ready to make the big reveal.
