Back in 2022, it was reported that a Jon Snow sequel series was in the works. So, what’s the latest update about the spinoff? We don’t exactly know nothing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jon-snow-game-of-thrones-series-hbo-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>The Game of Thrones universe continues to expand with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>House of the Dragon</a> and the upcoming &nbsp;A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Night series. From what <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kit Harington’s</strong></a> said about the series to the latest update, <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> has rounded up everything you need to know about the Jon Snow series.</p><h2>Jon Snow Series Release Date</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>There is no Jon Snow series release date as of now. The show hasn’t been officially greenlit by HBO yet. The initial news was reported by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in June 2022. At the time, the report claimed that the series was in “early development,” with <strong>Kit Harington</strong> set to return as the one and only Jon Snow.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Author <strong>George R. R. Martin</strong> confirmed in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>blog post</a> that same month that a Jon Snow series was in “development.” He noted that the working title for the show was Snow. George added, “Yes, it was Kit Harrington [sic] who brought the idea to us. I cannot tell you the names of the writers/showrunners, since that has not been cleared for release yet… but Kit brought them in too, his own team, and they are terrific.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Emilia Clarke</strong></a>, Kit’s former co-star, revealed that Kit had <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>told her about the series</a>. “It’s happening,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>BBC News</a> in June 2023. “It’s been created by Kit as far as I can understand, so he’s in it from the ground up. So what you will be watching, hopefully, if it happens, is certified by Kit Harington.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>In February 2023, <strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong> asked Kit point-blank about the spinoff series on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. Kit was incredibly cryptic and said he “can’t say anything” about the series.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>In May 2023, HBO’s head of drama, <strong>Francesca Orsi</strong>, gave an update about the Jon Snow series amid the ongoing <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>writers’ strike</a>. “We’re just working deeply with the writers to get it in shape for potential greenlight, but at this point, no, no determination on whether it can go all the way,” she told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>.</p><h2>What Would The Jon Snow Series Be About?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>The plot of the Jon Snow series hasn’t been officially revealed. In the Game of Thrones series finale, which aired in 2019 after 8 seasons, Jon Snow was exiled out of Westeros after killing Daenerys. He was last seen heading North of the Wall with the Wildlings. If the show does get greenlit, it would likely explore Jon’s life beyond the Wall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jon-snow-game-of-thrones-series-hbo-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>“I think if you asked him, he would’ve felt he got off lightly,” <strong>Kit Harington</strong> told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>EW</a> in December 2022. “At the end of the show when we find him in that cell, he’s preparing to be beheaded and he wants to be. He’s done. The fact he goes to the Wall is the greatest gift and also the greatest curse.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>He added, <span>“He’s gotta go back up to the place with all this history and live out his life thinking about how he killed Dany, and live out his life thinking about Ygritte dying in his arms, and live out his life thinking about how he hung Olly, and live out his life thinking about all of this trauma, and that… that’s interesting.” Kit emphasized that Jon Snow <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>is “not okay”</a> at the end of the series.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Will Other Game Of Thrones Cast Return?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>When asked if she’d ever return as Daenerys Targaryen, despite being killed by Jon Snow in the show’s series finale, <strong>Emilia Clarke</strong> responded to BBC News, “No, I think I’m done.” She was asked again in June 2023 about possibly reprising her role. “I don’t think so,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Extra</a>. “Kit, I love you! I’m going to watch that one because of you, or I am gonna tell you I did.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>She added, “I wouldn’t be in it no, I don’t think so… He hasn’t called… ‘Bro, you are my neighbor okay… and you killed me, spoiler alert!'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Prior to the news about the series being announced, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Maisie Williams</strong></a> was asked about a potential return to the role of Arya Stark. “I’m not saying it would never happen, but I’m also not saying it in this interview so that everyone goes… [gasps] ‘The spinoff! It’s coming!’ Because it’s not. It has to be the right time and the right people. It has to be right in the context of all the other spin-offs and the universe of Game of Thrones… It has to be the right time for me,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>GQ</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>A couple of months later, the Jon Snow series was brought up to Maisie in an interview. “We had such a rich show, and there’s still so much story to tell,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. “I think it’s really exciting, and I think that Kit is such a phenomenal actor. Him playing Jon Snow was just like a cultural reset. I think everything that he touches is magic, and I’m excited to see what it’s going to be.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8mopWarnqTEbr%2FEq6Ceq11qfnKFj2lvaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjon-snow-series-5119008.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjon-snow-series-5119008.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjon-snow-series-5119008.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjon-snow-series-5119008.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjon-snow-series-5119008.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjon-snow-series-5119008.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-michael-shermer-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-michael-shermer-dating.html>Who is Michael Shermer Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./wells-adams.html>Wells Adams Height, Age, Net Worth, Family, Partner</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./wells-adams.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
