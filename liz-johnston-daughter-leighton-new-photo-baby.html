We’re excited to introduce our baby to the world," the couple announced, sharing that their daughter weighed 5 pounds, 9 ounces at birth.</p><p>On the reality show, viewers followed Liz and Brice's love story, particularly when the couple&nbsp;<a href=#>moved in</a>&nbsp;together.</p><p>Liz and Brice, whom the TLC star began dating in 2018,&nbsp;announced they were expecting&nbsp;their first child together on September 28.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>“Welcoming our newest addition this fall, we couldn’t be more excited for Baby Bolden to arrive!” the couple told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>.</p><p>They also shared a photo of themselves posing with a “Baby Coming Nov 2023” sign and a sonogram image.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>'ONE MONTH WITH OUR GIRL'</h2><p>Liz recently shared a sweet&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">montage video</a>&nbsp;filled with photos and videos of Leighton's first month of life on her&nbsp;Instagram.</p><p>The photos range from newborn hospital photos and videos to clips of the first time parents with their baby at home.</p><p>In one clip in the video, Leighton could be seen in the classic white, blue, and pink hospital blanket above the plastic hospital bassinet.</p><p>A nurse held the newborn in one hand while feeding her with a metal spoon, and Brice held his new addition in a rocking chair on a patio.</p><p>Liz also shared a snapshot of herself cuddling her daughter as the&nbsp;<a href=#>TLC&nbsp;</a>star smiled at the camera.</p><p>Liz captioned the post: "One month with our girl, Leighton Drew words can’t express how much we love you, you’re the sweetest and happiest baby girl, and I can’t wait to see where life takes you."</p><p>Liz has also posted photos of her daughter on Instagram including getting her&nbsp;<a href=#>first bath</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>'DID SHE MOVE BACK HOME?'</h2><p>In late November, <a href=#>rumors of trouble</a> between Liz and Brice circulated when fans noticed matriarch&nbsp;<a href=#>Amber Johnston</a>, 44, sharing photos of Liz caring for the newborn back at her&nbsp;<a href=#>$400,000 Georgia home</a>.</p><p>Amber uploaded a snapshot of Liz sleeping on the couch as she held her newborn in her arms.</p><p>One fan took to an&nbsp;online thread&nbsp;and theorized: "I’ve seen Amber post quite a few stories of Elizabeth and the baby.&nbsp;</p><p>"I really do think she moved back into her mom's house. Does anyone else think she moved back there?"</p><p>Another fan claimed: "There doesn’t seem to be any photos of him with the baby except for the hospital ones while there have been plenty of her family members at home with her, but who knows if they’re still together or not."</p><p>A third fan speculated: "Brice was in the birth photos, but since they have been home, the only people I see the baby with is Liz and her family.&nbsp;</p><p>"Makes me wonder if they aren't separated too."</p><p>A fourth person wrote: "Elizabeth posted their family dog in the baby’s nursery today, too. She’s definitely living back at home."</p><p>A commentator chimed: "Right, I’m just not convinced they’re actually together anymore."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>FEUDING FAMILY</h2><p>Many fans were curious to know how Amber and Trent felt about the pregnancy due to a&nbsp;conflict they had with Liz and Brice in&nbsp;Season 11.</p><p>At the time, Liz told her parents she and Brice were moving in together and Brice respectfully asked for permission from Trent.</p><p>Amber was concerned that her daughter would move too fast in their relationship with an engagement and pregnancy.</p><p>“I know Dad and I really, really don’t want to see a wedding until you get school done,” Amber told Liz.</p><p>“Because it would be impossible for you to finish your degree if you get married and have a baby. Because once you get married, then it’s like ‘Oh, the next step: have a baby.’”</p><p>After delaying their move-in plans, the couple eventually settled down together in Season 13.</p><p>Despite Amber’s fears about Liz getting pregnant, she and Trent seemed thrilled with the baby news.</p><p>“I’m going to be a Boppa!” Trent wrote on Instagram, adding, “We are so happy and super excited for the first grand baby.”</p><p>Amber celebrated Leighton’s arrival on Instagram, writing, “We are so PROUD to announce our grand baby is here!!!!”</p><p>Trent added on his page, “We are super proud to announce the arrival of our granddaughter. Mom, Dad and baby are doing well! You can call me boppa!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>MEET THE JOHNSTONS</h2><p>Debuting in&nbsp;2015 on TLC, the lovable reality series&nbsp;follows the Johnston clan —&nbsp;mom Amber, dad Trent, and kids Jonah, Elizabeth, Anna, Alex, and Emma.</p><p>They, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC News</a>, refer to themselves as "the real life seven dwarfs," and consist of "a mix of biological and adopted children from various parts of the globe," per the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mirror</a>.</p><p>They're also, as ABC&nbsp;News explained, "The largest family of achondroplasia dwarfs … a type of dwarfism that affects the extremities."</p><p>As a result, no member of the family is taller than four feet.&nbsp;</p><p>After Jonah and Elizabeth were born (both via C-section), the Johnstons chose to start adopting.</p><p>Soon arrived, "Anna from Russia, Alex from South Korea, and Emma from China," per the&nbsp;<a href=#>show's description.</a></p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>In August, the series was <a href=#>renewed</a> for a 14th Season but there's no premiere date yet.</p><p>That said, fans seemingly can't wait for more of the caring, close-knit clan who once endeared audiences with a no-holds-barred <a href=#>Grease music video.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/7-little-johnston-fans-suspect-862635128.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/liz-johnstons-partner-brice-bolden-857781404.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/anna-johnston-amber-johnston-emma-754341146-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxaGeCeISPaKOisl2fvKm60q2mp2WUlsKotNOeqWaklZ60qcDOp2Snnadivam706hkm5mSrnw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fliz-johnston-daughter-leighton-new-photo-baby.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fliz-johnston-daughter-leighton-new-photo-baby.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fliz-johnston-daughter-leighton-new-photo-baby.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fliz-johnston-daughter-leighton-new-photo-baby.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fliz-johnston-daughter-leighton-new-photo-baby.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fliz-johnston-daughter-leighton-new-photo-baby.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./favourite-names-drivers-give-cars.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./favourite-names-drivers-give-cars.html>Drivers love to name their cars - with monikers including Betsy, George and Beast the top favourites</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jonny-lee-millers-wife-list.html>Who is Jonny Lee Miller Dating Jonny Lee Miller's Wife &amp;amp; Exes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jonny-lee-millers-wife-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
