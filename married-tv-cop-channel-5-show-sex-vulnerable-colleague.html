Paul Faulkner - known to fans of <a href=#>Police Interceptors</a> by his nickname "Mustard" - has been accused of gross misconduct by Cleveland <a href=#>Police</a>.</p><img

dad-of-two is said to have started a sexual relationship with a female cop, referred to as "Officer A", while he was supposed to be supporting her as a Police Federation rep.</p><p>He met the woman while she was under investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct.</p><p>She went on sick leave and it was PC Faulkner's role to make sure her interests were looked after.</p><p>But he allegedly slipped her his phone number and embarked on a fling with his fellow copper, before lying to bosses to cover his tracks.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE NEWS">READ MORE NEWS</h2><p>PC Faulkner - who is married to a serving officer - is also accused of urging her to lie if she was ever asked about their affair.</p><p>The policeman now faces a disciplinary hearing after being accused of breaching professional standards.</p><p>Cleveland Police claim his behaviour amounts to gross misconduct which, if proved,&nbsp;will likely lead&nbsp;to him being sacked.</p><p>The dad was part of the joint Durham and Cleveland Road Policing Unit which was catapulted to national fame by the Channel 5 show between 2015 and 2018.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>In one action-packed episode in December 2017, his car was rammed by two robbers on a dual carriageway flyover high above a river.</p><p>Luckily a barrier prevented him and his colleague from plunging 66ft into the water below.</p><p>In another episode, he took the lead in a dangerous high-speed pursuit before the suspects finally ditched the car and hid in the undergrowth.</p><p>PC Faulkner became a firm favourite with fans and relished in the limelight, sharing pictures of himself signing autographs on <a href=#>Twitter</a>.</p><p>His Police Interceptors profile describes him as an operational firearms commander, lists his favourite sportsman as <a href=#>Jenson Button</a> and his guilty pleasure as ballroom dancing.</p><p>The married cop met Officer A when he was working with the Police Federation and was present when she was served disciplinary papers in September 2019.</p><p>She went on sick leave two months later and he became her official Federation representative, after allegedly giving her his number via social media.</p><h2>AFFAIR ALLEGATIONS</h2><p>The pair then allegedly began a relationship that became sexual, despite Faulkner insisting there was "nothing going on" to his superior.</p><p>Cleveland Police allege that his "role placed him in a position of responsibility" and "he knew or ought to have known that she was vulnerable at the material time."</p><p>PC Faulkner is also accused of lying to bosses about the relationship and urging the female cop to also lie if she was asked about it.</p><p>In April 2020 PC Faulkner posed for a local paper with his wife Jane, also a serving cop, and their children as they spoke of the effects of the pandemic on front line staff.</p><p>At the time, he said: "It’s such a difficult time for many families, and with us both being key workers we’re having to manage our time differently now and it does have an impact.</p><p>"We’ve seen real praise from local people who are genuinely thankful for the work that we do, and it does give us a real boost.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title

some changes and sacrifices in our personal lives, but being able to help on the frontline makes it all worth it.”</p><p>PC Faulkner faces a disciplinary hearing in Stockton on Tuesday.</p><img
