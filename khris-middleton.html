He was their second child after daughter Brittney Middleton.</p><p>One of his cousins, Josh Powell, has also played in the NBA. Another cousin, Kenny Manigault, and Middleton played as teammates for Wichita State University.</p><p>In addition, the two cousins played on the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) team Carolina Celtics.</p><p>Khris attended Porter-Gaud School in his hometown. He played really good basketball under coach John Pearson for the Cyclones. He averaged 12 points and eight rebounds in each game in his sophomore year.</p><p>Middleton averaged 21 points and 8.6 rebounds per game in his Junior season. This season he was named the state player of the year.</p><p>Even in his senior year, he was named player of the year. The 6-feet 7-inches player led Porter-Gaud to the state title game. He scored 22.4 points per game and 8.6 rebounds per game.</p><p>The Most Valuable Player of the Porter-Gaud Holiday Classic was awarded to Khris Middleton with 22 points in the championship.</p><p>In 2009, Khris was nominated for the Mcdonald’s All-American Boys Game. But unfortunately, he was not selected.&nbsp;</p><p>ESPN ranked him the 64th-best prospect in the Class of 2009. In addition, Middleton was tipped as the best shooter in his position.</p><p>On May 30, 2008, he was recruited by the Texas A&M Virginia Tech, South Carolina, Michigan, and Saint Joseph’s.</p><p>It is believed that Khris liked the college town atmosphere and got well with the coaching team.&nbsp;</p><h2>Khris Middleton&nbsp;<span>| </span>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Khris Middleton is 32 years old. He stands tall at 6 feet and 7 inches and weighs 222 lbs.</p><p>His Body Mass Index (BMI) is 25, and slightly overweight. Moreover, his tall and muscular body makes it easy for him to compete with the most potent players in the NBA.</p><h2>Khris Middleton <span>| College Life</span></h2><h3>Freshman Year</h3><p>Scott Spinelli, assistant coach of Texas A&M, recruited Middleton. He was expected to fill the three-point shooting void left by Josh Carter in his first year.</p><p>He started slowly in his first three games, connecting 1-of12 field goals in limited action. Then, an unfortunate event happened to Derrick Roland, who suffered a season-ending leg injury.</p><p>Even with his inexperience Khris was forced to take the risk in the offense for the team. As a result, he started 18 of the last 20 games for Texas A&M.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/khris-middleton-shoots-for-the-bucks.jpg><p>Texas A&M defeated Missouri 77-74, in which Middleton scored 16 points to erase an 11-point second-half deficit.</p><p>Then, his team defeated Utah State in Round 64 of the NCAA tournament, and Middleton scored his career-best 19 points.</p><p>But, sadly, Texas A&M lost to Purdue in Round 32. Overall, Khris averaged 7.2 points and 3.7 rebounds per game.</p><h3>Sophomore Year</h3><p>In his sophomore year, Texas A&M finished ninth in the Big 12, led by Middleton. He averaged 14.3 points and 5.2 rebounds per game that year.</p><p>Again, his record was quite impressive. He hit 45% of his shots and had 78.4% accuracy for free throws.</p><p>Middleton’s team defeated Arkansas 71-62 in overtime, in which he scored a career-high 31 points. He scored 11 of his team’s last 12 points in the game.</p><p>His fantastic performance earned him the Oscar Robertson National Player of the Week honors on December 13-19, 2010.</p><p>Basketball Writers Association named Midleton in the 10-man All-District VII team covering college basketball players in Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana.</p><p>The National Association of Basketball Coaches selected him as an All-Eight District second-team, making him eligible for the State Farm Division I All-America teams.</p><h3>Junior Year</h3><p>The head coach Mark Turgeon of Texas A&M, left for the University of Maryland, and Billy Kennedy, head coach of Murray State, came in.</p><p>Murray’s coaching style impressed Midleton, who chose to stay with the Aggies.&nbsp;</p><p>This year he was listed by the Wooden Award on the preseason watch list. In addition, Khris was tipped for the preseason All-Big 12 team by a unanimous choice.</p><p>Middleton suffered a knee injury, forcing him to stay out of action for 12 games. As a result, his team had a disappointing season despite being the co-favorite in the league.</p><p>They finished with 4-14 in the Big 12 and 14-18 overall.</p><p>His stats degraded from last season, as he averaged 13.2 points and 5.0 rebounds per game.</p><p>In a statement, Middleton thanked Texas A&M as he declared for the NBA draft.&nbsp;</p><h2>Khris Middleton <span>| Professional Career</span></h2><h3>Detroit Pistons&nbsp;</h3><p>In the 2012 NBA draft, the Detroit Pistons selected Middelton with the 39th overall pick. He signed the rookie contract with the Pistons in August.</p><p>In December, he saw little action with the Pistons and was assigned to the Fort Wayne Mad Ants of the NBA Development League (G League). The following week he was recalled by the Pistons.</p><p>Khris only played 27 games in his first season with the Pistons. He averaged just 6.1 points, 1.9 rebounds, and 1.0 assists, averaging only 17.6 minutes per game.</p><h3>Milwaukee Bucks&nbsp;</h3><p>The Milwaukee Bucks traded their guard Brandon Jennings in exchange for Middleton, <a href=#>Brandon Knight</a>, and Viacheslav Kravtsov on July 31, 2013.</p><p>In his first season, Middleton played in all 82 games. He averaged 12.1 points, 2.8 rebounds, 2.1 assists, and 1.0 steals, where he started 64 games.&nbsp;</p><p>Middleton scored 29 points in a win over Washington Wizard in December for the first time in his career.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/khris-middleton-in-a-game.jpg><p>In his second season, the Charleston-born star scored a game-winning buzzer-beater to defeat the Suns. This season, he also got a career-high 30 points in a win against the Washington Wizard.&nbsp;</p><p>Middleton became an important “3-and-D” player for the Bucks, with 46.7 shooting percent from the floor and 40.7 percent behind the three-point arc.&nbsp;</p><h3>Contract Extension</h3><p>Middleton signed a $70 million contract with the Bucks for five years on July 9, 2015. In a defeat against the Oklahoma City Thunder, he scored his career-high 36 points.&nbsp;</p><p>He has also marked the most three-pointers made by a Bucks player since Carlos Delfino after his performance against the Minnesota Timberwolves.</p><p>The 6-foot 7-inch giant suffered a left hamstring injury in the preseason, which forced him to be on the sidelines for six months. This injury required surgery too.&nbsp;</p><p>He made his comeback against the Miami Heat, where his team lost. Middleton featured for 15 minutes in this game.&nbsp;</p><p>Khris kept improving after his injury, scoring 43 points in the Charlotte Hornets loss in November 2017.</p><p>He made his first triple-double in a loss to the Philadelphia 76ers, making 23 points, 14 rebounds, and ten assists.&nbsp;</p><p>Middleton played through with a quad injury in a win over the Brooklyn Nets, scoring 29 points in December.&nbsp;</p><p>In January, he was named in the Eastern Conference All-Sar reserve, earning him a career-first All-Star selection in the 2018-19 season. He was also the first G League player to be named an All-Star.</p><h3>New Contract</h3><p>Milwaukee Bucks extended their contract with Khris for another five years for $178 million from the 2019-20 season. Following his new deal, he scored a career-high 51 points in a win over the Washington Wizards.</p><p>After his game with the Wizards, Middelton dedicated one of his best performances to the late Kobe Bryant, who died two days before his match.</p><p>He said, “I definitely can dedicate that game to him as a thank you for what he did for the game.”</p><p><strong><a href=#>Everything you need to know about Kobe Bryant’s Net Worth: Stats, House, Cars, Lifestyle, Kids & Death>></a></strong></p><p>After being named to the Eastern Conference All-star reserve, he earned his second All-Star selection.</p><p>The Miami Heat eliminated the Bucks and Middleton in the Semifinals in just five games. However, the Heat went on to win the Eastern Conference Championship. In the Bucks’ only win, Middelton scored 39 points.</p><h3>Championship season&nbsp;</h3><p>Following their defeat to the Heats in the previous season, the two faced each other again, but this time the Bucks prevailed.</p><p>Middleton scored 27 points in the first game, including a game-winning fadeaway jumper with just 0.5 seconds left in the clock.&nbsp;</p><p>The Bucks went on the win the series in just four games.&nbsp;</p><p>Middleton and his team defeated the Brooklyn Nets in the semifinals, in which he scored career-high 38 points that included ten rebounds and five assists.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/khris-with-teammate-giannis-from-the-bucks-scaled.jpg><p>In the Conference Finals, the Bucks defeated the Hawks 118-107. Khris had a phenomenal game where he scored 32 points leading his team to their first NBA finals since 1974.</p><p>The Charleston-born player faced the Phoenix Suns in the NBA Finals.
