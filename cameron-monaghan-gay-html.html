<time>15 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Cameron Monaghan, who rose to fame through his part as Ian Gallagher on Shameless, seems like he has been around forever. But in all these years in show business, he has revealed very little about his personal life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>People are usually curious about his dating life, and within that, they are always interested to know if he is gay. The rumor has surrounded the actor since the very beginning of his days in the industry.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The rumors seem to stem from a character he played, but is there any truth to them? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>The Origins of Cameron Monaghan’s Gay Rumors</h2><p>Ian Gallagher and Shameless are the main things that set off the rumors. The show, which was his first BIG job, saw him portraying a gay character at the age of 17. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Gallagher was not a typical gay teenager character prevalent on TV when Shameless premiered in 2011.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>"He’s the anti-stereotype. He never does anything that’s stereotypically perceived as “gay,"' Monaghan described his character during an <a href=# rel="follow noopener">interview</a> with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Vanity Fair</a> in 2011. "He’s tough, he’s street smart, and he’s pretty much unlike any gay teenager on television right now." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Monaghan portrayed Gallagher until the show's end in 2021, which means the questions about his sexuality have lasted for over a decade.</p><h2>Is Cameron Monaghan Gay?</h2><p>No, he is not. And that has been known since the beginning of the show, only not publicized enough to get rid of the speculations.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>During the aforementioned Vanity Fair interview, he admitted to being straight but still enjoying the part. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I’m not gay myself, but it’s a role I’m very happy to play," he said. "I’m always happy to support the gay community. Ian’s a really fantastic part."</p><p></p><p><strong>Cameron Monaghan</strong> (Photo: Cameron Monaghan/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He re-emphasized the point of Gallagher being a "non-stereotypical part," which made him enjoying the role much easier. "And I was so interested that I read the whole script, and I was hooked. I became a fan of the show before I was even cast," he added.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Monaghan thought Gallagher's story — living in a neighborhood which did not accept homosexuality and&nbsp;being closeted and insecure about his&nbsp;sexuality — would resonate with a lot of American teens.</p><p>Only 17 at the time, Monaghan was then asked about how his mother reacted to&nbsp;him portraying a homosexual character so young. He said his mom was okay with it and that it was just "acting" and "really not that big a deal."</p><p>John Wells, the executive producer of the show, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said in 2012</a> that Monaghan had "completely embraced the idea of [the] character." His realistic, authentic portrayal might have been one of the many reasons the show got such good reviews, both from fans and critics alike, and even fan letters from gay teenagers saying thank you.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Does Cameron Monaghan Have a Wife?</h2><p>As of August 2022, Monaghan does not seem to be married or have a wife. The Paradise Highway actor has had a <a href=# rel=follow>few girlfriends</a> in the past, though.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>His first girlfriend in public was Peyton List. They started dating in 2017 after working together on the indie movie&nbsp;Anthem of a Teenage Prophet. Their relationship&nbsp;lasted two years. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Then, in October 2020, Monaghan went Instagram official with LA-based model Laurel Searle. It's not clear if they are still dating, but posts Searle made mentioning him on her Instagram are still up. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJuRorKzu81mpKimkZy1orqMoJiyZpipuq0%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcameron-monaghan-gay-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcameron-monaghan-gay-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcameron-monaghan-gay-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcameron-monaghan-gay-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcameron-monaghan-gay-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcameron-monaghan-gay-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./toy-washing-machines-kids-chores-mum-cleaning-fans.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./toy-washing-machines-kids-chores-mum-cleaning-fans.html>You can now buy toy washing machines so the kids can join in the chores and cleaning fanatics are ra</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./summer-house-season-7-is-released-on-bravo.html>Summer House Season 7 Is Released On Bravo</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./summer-house-season-7-is-released-on-bravo.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
