However, her name has most recently been circulated due to her ties to&nbsp;Ted Lasso actor <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jason Sudeikis</strong></a>, 47. The duo have known each other since at least 2014 and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> began dating in 2021</a> following Jason’s split from actress and director <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Olivia Wilde</strong></a>, 38, at the beginning of 2020. Keeley, 38, was one of the people whom Jason “turned towards,” a report from <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Sun</a> claimed on Feb. 28, 2021. Later in the year, their romance was confirmed when they were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>caught sharing a romantic kiss</a> in Cabo.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>They broke up by mid-2022, according to<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> The Sun</a>. However, that didn’t stop<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Keeley from seemingly throwing some shade at Olivia</a> after she was involved in more drama regarding her relationship with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Harry Styles</strong></a>&nbsp;and how her romance with Jason ended. After Jason and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Olivia’s former nanny claimed</a> Jason lost it after Olivia made her special salad dressing for her new beau, Olivia addressed the gossip by s<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>haring the dressing recipe</a> on her<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Instagram</a> Story. Keeley then posted a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Story</a> of her own, which showed an except from the 1983 book, Heartburn by <strong>Nora Ephron</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/keeley-hazell-british-model-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>“Vera said: ‘Why do you feel you have to turn everything into a story?’” the passage began, which Keeley underlined. “So I told her why: Because if I tell the story, I control the version. Because if I tell the story, I can make you laugh, and I would rather have you laugh at me than feel sorry for me,” the excerpt continued. “Because if I tell the story, it doesn’t hurt as much. Because if I tell the story, I can get on with it.” The Story by Keeley came just two days after Olivia shared the salad dressing recipe.</p><h2>Keeley Kick-Started Her Modeling Career After Winning A Big Contest</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Keeley got her start as an iconic <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>glamour model</a> in Britain. The London native won The Daily Star‘s “Search for a Beach Babe” at just 17 years old. However, she did not catapult into mainstream stardom right away. Instead, she chose to study fashion at Lewisham College. Her big break came afterward in Dec. 2004, when she won the “Page 3 Idol” contest that was running in The Sun.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Thanks to her big win in the “Page 3 Idol” contest, Keeley went on to be a sought-after magazine model. She also graced the front covers of magazines like Maxim&nbsp;and&nbsp;FHM, and made regular appearances in the weekly British lads’ magazines&nbsp;Zoo Weekly&nbsp;and&nbsp;Nuts. All of these magazines are now defunct, however.</p><h2>Keeley Has A Memoir Coming Out</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/keeley-hazell-british-model-shutterstock-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Keeley Announced in Oct. 2022 that she’s working on a memoir called Everyone’s Seen My T—s. “Sooooooo beyond excited to announce that I signed a book deal with @grandcentralpub for my memoir…” she wrote on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> alongside a photo of a transcript. According to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Yahoo! Entertainment</a>, her writing will explore “class, feminism, fame, abuse, sexual violence, and what it means to be a woman.”</p><h2>She’s Also An Actress & Has Starred In ‘St. George’s Day’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>After three years of glamour modeling, Keeley made her segue into acting at the age of 22 years old, according to a 2017 interview in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Independent</a>. She took acting lessons at the prestigious The Lee Strasberg Theatre & Film Institute and has appeared in movies like&nbsp;St. George’s Day,&nbsp;Cashback,&nbsp;Awful Nice, and&nbsp;Horrible Bosses 2&nbsp;(where she met Jason). Keeley also held a recurring role as Violet on the TV series&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Royals</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“I wanted to act from a young age and I didn’t seem like a reality for me growing up. My family were poor so really early I didn’t think that would be something that could happen My family were poor so really early I didn’t think that would be something that could happen and when I modeled, I realized I didn’t want to do it anymore, and I thought with acting ‘I really want to give this a shot,'” the star told The Independent.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>After meeting Jason on&nbsp;Horrible Bosses 2, she went on to play the role of Bex in a few episodes of his Apple TV+ series <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ted Lasso</a>&nbsp;that premiered in Aug. 2020. She even had a character on the show named after her: Keeley Jones, a model played by actress <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Juno Temple</strong></a>.</p><h2>Keeley Is Passionate About Helping Save The Environment</h2><p class=mol-para-with-font>&nbsp;“I’ve been interested in green issues for some time. I don’t see how anyone who reads the papers or listens to the news can fail to be,” Keeley wrote in an essay for the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail </a>in 2007. “Global warming is something that seriously worries me and I’m happy to do anything I can to help slow down climate change.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>In 2006, the model and actress was recognized as an “environmental hero” by former UK Prime Minister <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>David Cameron</strong></a>, according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Evening Standard</a>.</p><h2>Keeley Has Been Romantically Linked To Other Famous Stars</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/keeley-david-walliams-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>Jason is not the only famous name whom Keeley has been tied to. She has also sparked romantic speculation in the past with football stars <strong>Anton Ferdinand</strong> and <strong>Joe Cole</strong>, as well as&nbsp;Britain’s Got Talent&nbsp;host <strong>David Williams</strong>. Keeley even allegedly stayed at David’s home when she returned from the U.S., according to a July 2020 report from <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Sun</a>. However, sources told the outlet that David and Keeley are just friends despite having a “special chemistry.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K4prHLnrBmoJGvsq24jKamnZ2cYq6kwNGeqqxlZGiBcn2PbmY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-keeley-hazell-model-actress-4341105.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-keeley-hazell-model-actress-4341105.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-keeley-hazell-model-actress-4341105.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-keeley-hazell-model-actress-4341105.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-keeley-hazell-model-actress-4341105.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-keeley-hazell-model-actress-4341105.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./a-taylor-swift-themed-cruise-will-set-sail-in-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./a-taylor-swift-themed-cruise-will-set-sail-in-2024.html>A Taylor SwiftThemed Cruise Will Set Sail in 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-ashley-pickens-dating.html>Who is Ashley Pickens Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-ashley-pickens-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
