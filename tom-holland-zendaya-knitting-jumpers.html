<time>30 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>AS COMIC book lovebirds Spider-Man and MJ in the hit Marvel movies their ­relationship was never short of action.</p><p>But off screen, real-life couple Tom Holland and Zendaya are more “Spider-Nan” after spending their evenings knitting jumpers as gifts for their friends and family this Christmas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/58107d3d-b389-4c54-a046-7a3961c6f4f5.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tom-holland-zendaya-seen-october-663361647.jpg><p>In an exclusive chat, the Hollywood actress, 27, said: “People know I love to knit.</p><p>"I know it isn’t something you would normally associate with a girl my age, but it’s actually become very cool and I find it really relaxing.</p><p>“I have got Tom into knitting as well — and we’ve done jumpers for everybody this Christmas.”</p><p>Zendaya was first linked to Tom, also 27, in 2016, after they were cast alongside each other in <a href=#>Spider-Man: Homecoming</a>.</p><p>But Tom revealed that when she was not in character at the centre of the action, his stunning co-star spent her time stitching scarves on the set of Spider-Man: No Way Home in 2021.</p><p><a href=#>On filming with Zendaya</a>, the British actor said: “I’d be doing the most intense fight scenes on set and you used to come to set to watch quite a lot.</p><p>“I would be there with blood all over my face, I’d be fighting The Goblin, and you’d be there just knitting.”</p><p>Sitting alongside Tom on the Graham Norton Show in 2021, Zendaya added: “I loved it as a pastime.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>"I love little tedious activities to keep my brain occupied. I made everyone scarves.</p><p>“I was like, ‘What am I going to get everyone for Christmas?’</p><p>“So I was like, ‘I will make them some scarves because that is what I am doing all day’.”</p><p>Zendaya and Tom confirmed their romance in July 2021 when they were spotted kissing in his £90,000 Audi sports car at a red light in Los Angeles.</p><p>Despite having a Bafta and three Spider-Man films under his belt, Tom went to great lengths to impress Zendaya — including taking up her favourite hobby last year.</p><p>It was not long before a snap of the actor — taken by a fan during a flight — went viral on TikTok, captioned: “Your mother’s friend was sitting next to Tom Holland on the plane and she sent you a picture of him knitting.”</p><p>And despite becoming Hollywood’s latest golden couple, Zendaya said she does not feel obliged to splash out on extravagant gifts for her boyfriend, who has an estimated net worth of £20million.</p><p>She said: “There is pressure with Tom, he openly admits to being a gift returner.</p><p>"I just don’t have it in me to do it, it feels so mean.</p><p>"If I get a Christmas gift I don’t like, I just smile and say thank you. But with Tom you can definitely tell if he doesn’t like a gift.”</p><p>The couple were understood to have picked up the keys to their <a href=#>six-bedroom pad</a> in Richmond, South West London, last year — four miles from Kingston upon Thames, where Tom grew up.</p><p>But California-born Zendaya revealed that cooking at their £3million home is not the perfect Christmas scene that fans would expect from their fairytale romance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/www-instagram-com-reel-cfz0rr7tecn-867323808.jpg><p>She said: “I love the thought of us both being in the kitchen cooking Christmas dinner and dancing around to Christmas music, but as idyllic as that scenario sounds, it just wouldn’t happen.</p><p>“We are both just too controlling in the kitchen and would be telling the other one what to do.</p><p>“Tom has been practising in the kitchen, so he is going to be in charge this year.”</p><p>Yet asked about the secret to their relationship, Zendaya said: “Apart from the obvious, I just think it is so important to have fun with each other.</p><p>"For us, that is laughing together, dancing together, singing together and occasionally rocking out to some Beyonce.”</p><p><a href=#>Zendaya was thrust into the spotlight</a> aged 14 through her role as Rocky Blue in Disney’s Shake It Up.</p><p>She went on to star in The Greatest Showman in 2017 as trapeze artist Anne Wheeler, alongside <a href=#>Zac Efron</a>, before playing Rue Bennett — an androgynous character fresh from rehab — in HBO teen series Euphoria in 2019.</p><p>In 2021, she starred as <a href=#>Chani in Dune</a>, with her character set to return to the big screen next year for part two of the adventure blockbuster, which also stars Timothee Chalamet and Florence Pugh.</p><p>However, Zendaya and Tom can never escape the rumours surrounding Spider-Man 4.</p><p>Of the Marvel film favourite returning to the cinema, Zendaya said: “There is always so much secrecy with Spider-Man... so there is very little I can say.</p><p>“The end of the last movie was powerful, but at the same time very sad.</p><p>“Tom and I were genuinely sad by the ending, not disappointed, but sad for the characters that they didn’t get to swing off into the sunset with each other."</p><p>And she teased: “Maybe there is still time for that.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Tom said last month that he was “actively engaging with conversations” about a return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Peter Parker — but only if the next film can do the character justice.</p><p>He told entertainment website Collider: “I feel very protective over Spider-Man.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Make a stand</h2><p>“I feel very, very lucky that we were able to work on a franchise that got better with each movie, that got more successful with each movie, which I think is really rare, and I want to protect his legacy.</p><p>“So I won’t make another one for the sake of making another one. It will have to be worth the while of the character.”</p><p>After rising to fame as a child star, Zendaya revealed that her parents Claire and Kazembe, both teachers, taught her the importance of standing up for herself in the male-dominated movie world.</p><p>“My parents have always just wanted me to be happy, and the best advice they have given me is to say no to things I am not comfortable with,” she said.</p><p>“I think, over the last few years in Hollywood, we have seen the importance of the word no and that it must be respected.</p><p>“As young females in the industry, we must stick together and make a stand.”</p><p>It comes after Zendaya spoke out against disgraced movie mogul <a href=#>Harvey Weinstein</a>, who was found guilty of rape and sexual assault in courts in New York and Los Angeles.</p><p>Speaking on the red carpet in 2017, after the allegations emerged, Zendaya said: “I mean, it’s disgusting.</p><p>“There is really no other way to put it — it is awful and that is really all I can say about that.”</p><p>Her comments came after she sang the lead in the title song for the musical adaptation of Finding Neverland in 2015, which Weinstein produced.</p><p>In support of the #MeToo movement she wrote on X/Twitter: “As a young woman in this industry I am deeply grateful to all the courageous women coming forward and speaking their truth.</p><p>“I truly thank you for making the first huge steps towards assuring that this industry will be safer for young actresses like myself.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Looking ahead to next year, she added: “The dream for me is to keep on getting roles where I read the script and just think, ‘Yes, I want to play that character’.</p><p>“I do want to start spending time behind the camera though, I have this ambition to direct a really beautiful movie.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tom-holland-knitting-flight-867322885.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxaWiAc4OPaKuopV2dvK24wKebZrKVo7GixcBmoqehpKm2r7OMo6ymqJWnwHA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftom-holland-zendaya-knitting-jumpers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftom-holland-zendaya-knitting-jumpers.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftom-holland-zendaya-knitting-jumpers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftom-holland-zendaya-knitting-jumpers.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftom-holland-zendaya-knitting-jumpers.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftom-holland-zendaya-knitting-jumpers.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nikki-gives-justin-a-48-hour-ultimatum-on-90-day-fiance-recap.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nikki-gives-justin-a-48-hour-ultimatum-on-90-day-fiance-recap.html>Nikki Gives Justin a 48-Hour Ultimatum</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gremlins-home-alone-haviland-morris-unrecognisable.html>Gremlins and Home Alone star Haviland Morris unrecognisable after 90s movie career - and now works a</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gremlins-home-alone-haviland-morris-unrecognisable.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
