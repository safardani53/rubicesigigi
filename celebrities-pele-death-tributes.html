Prior to his death, his medical team confirmed he was battling “kidney and cardiac dysfunctions.” As mentioned above, many celebrities and professional soccer players have begun to publicly mourn the legendary soccer player.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Pele-tribute-shutter-embed-1.jpg><h2>Barack Obama</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Former U.S. President Barack Obama, 61, took to Instagram on Dec. 29 to share a sweet <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>throwback photo</a> with Pele. “Pelé was one of the greatest to ever play the beautiful game,” his caption began. “And as one of the most <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>recognizable athletes</a> in the world, he understood the power of sports to bring people together. Our thoughts are with his family and everyone who loved and admired him.” The snapshot, also seen above, pictured Obama and Pele posing together while the late soccer star and the 61-year-old held up a yellow soccer jersey signed by the G.O.A.T. himself.</p><h2>Cristiano Ronaldo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cristiano-Ronaldo-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Professional soccer player&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong></a>, 37, also made sure to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pay tribute</a> to “The Greatest” on Dec. 29. “My deep condolences to all of Brazil, and in particular to the family of Edson Arantes do Nascimento. A mere ‘goodbye’ to the eternal King Pelé will never be enough to express the pain that the entire <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>football world</a> is currently embracing,” the Portugal national team athlete wrote. “An inspiration to so many millions, a reference yesterday, today and forever. The love you always showed me was reciprocated in every moment we shared even from distance. He will never be forgotten and his memory will live forever in each and every one of us football lovers. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rest in peace</a> King Pelé.”</p><h2>Kylian Mbappé</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kylian-Mbappe-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>Kylian Mbappé</strong>, 24, who plays on the French national soccer team, took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a> to pay his respects like his soccer colleagues the day of Pele’s passing. “The king of football has left us but his legacy will never be forgotten. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>RIP KING</a>…,” he captioned the black-and-white photo of him posing with the legend. The 24-year-old also added a broken heart emoji and crown to the caption.</p><h2>Lionel Messi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MESSI-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lionel Messi</strong></a>, 35, who is one of soccer’s most talented athletes took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to grieve Pele as well. “Rest in peace, @pele,” he captioned the carousel of photos with the late icon.

I’ve read this phrase somewhere, at some point in my life. But this sentence, beautiful, is incomplete,” he began. “I would say before Pelé <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>football</a> was just a sport. Pelé has changed it all. He turned football into art, into entertainment Gave voice to the poor, blacks and mostly: Gave visibility to Brazil. Soccer and Brazil have raised their status thanks to the King! He’s gone but his magic remains. Pelé is FOREVER!!” Neymar not only plays for the national team of Brazil, but also the Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain.</p><h2>David Beckham</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/David-Beckhan-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Former English soccer player, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>David Beckham</strong></a>, 47, was another athlete that was saddened to hear of Pele’s passing.
