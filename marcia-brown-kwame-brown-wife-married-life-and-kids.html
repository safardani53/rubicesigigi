The couple has two beautiful children named Kwame and Lauren.</strong></p><p>Kwame Hasani Brown (born March 10, 1982) is a former American basketball player who played 12 seasons in the National Basketball Association.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Untitled-design-31-5.jpg><p>Hasani was chosen straight out of high school as the first No. 1 overall pick in the 2001 NBA draft and was also the 16th player from high school.</p><p>The performance of the basketball player impressed many analysts and was labeled as one of the biggest busts in the history of the NBA.</p><p>During high school, he repeatedly became the best high school player. Also, the player was named school player of the year as a senior in Georgia.</p><p>Similarly, in 2001, he was named to McDaniel’s All-American team and was honored with the Mr. Georgia Basketball title.</p><h2>Kwame Brown Wife</h2><p>Kwame Brown has been married to Marcia Brown for a long time. Brown was a teacher by profession even before they were married.</p><p>This beautiful pair has two children, one son and one daughter, named Kwame Jr. and Lauren.</p><p>His son’s name is African, indicating “Born on Saturday.” Both of his kids, Kwame Jr. and Lauren, go to DC public schools.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/52681232_512787162458666_4123814928066589002_n-min-1632153382220-scaled-1.jpg><p>Before his relationship with Marcia, Kwame was in a relationship with Joselyn Vaughn. Joselyn was Kwame’s high school sweetheart. However, their marriage resulted in a divorce.</p><p>Kwame shared three daughters with Joselyn. After their divorce, Vaughn had a tough time raising three kids on her own and filed a case against Brown.</p><p>Vaughn accused Brown of not providing child support and was only available to sign the birth certificates of their daughters.</p><p>However, there is no news of the case settlement or information regarding Joselyn and her three daughters.</p><h2>Kwane Brown Eviscerates Ja Morant</h2><p>The Memphis Grizzlies star <a href=#>Ja Morant</a> gained much public attention after he appeared with a gun during an Instagram Live.</p><p>The Grizzlies released a statement that read, “He is suspended from all team activities pending League review. We have no further comment at the time.”</p><p>However, it was not concluded that the gun belonged to Morant, and the league does not believe that the player had the gun at any NBA facilities.</p><p>Previously, the NBA handed Morant <a href=# rel=noopener>an eight-game suspension</a> without pay for a similar case.</p><p>Regarding the Grizzlies point guard’s gun case, Kwame Brown had few words to say in a nine-minute video on his YouTube.</p><p>“I’ve heard of NBA YoungBoy, but you are NBA Dumb Boy. You got to be the dumbest motherf–ker in the league. You’ve got $231 million promised to you, and you want to be a f–king thug.”</p><p>He further added, “Yeah, it’s OK for you to have a gun. You have a Second Amendment right to have a gun. But what the f–k you keep pulling it out menacing for?</p><h2>Kwane Brown Legal Issues</h2><p>Throughout his career, Kwame Brown was arrested, charged, and accused of various allegations.</p><p>In August 2003, Kwame was charged with driving under the influence near his hometown of Brunswick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1257701549.webp><p>Again, after 4 years, in October 2007, the player was charged with disorderly conduct in Georgia.</p><p>Not only that, Brown was also charged with interfering with a law enforcement officer.</p><p>Again, on March 31, 2019, the year Joselyn sued him, Brown was arrested by Georgia Police for the possession of edible marijuana products.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC5wKuaopldl7%2Bww81morCZnZp6o77OsKVmr5mbsm65wKupop2UYrmqssRmmKecXaC2pb%2BO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarcia-brown-kwame-brown-wife-married-life-and-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmarcia-brown-kwame-brown-wife-married-life-and-kids.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmarcia-brown-kwame-brown-wife-married-life-and-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmarcia-brown-kwame-brown-wife-married-life-and-kids.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarcia-brown-kwame-brown-wife-married-life-and-kids.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarcia-brown-kwame-brown-wife-married-life-and-kids.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./will-muschamp.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./will-muschamp.html>Will Muschamp</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./xixfhccejhnrjr8yvhr3qbidgehl6n59.html>Watch Why Women Kill Season 1 Episode 7: I Found Out What The Secret To Murder Is: Friends.
