The couple faced many challenges during their time together, as Flav pleaded guilty to assaulting her in 1991. He subsequently spent 30 days in jail and lost custody of his children. Following the incident, Flav’s family also staged an intervention after domestic violence and numerous drug charges were filed against him. Since then, Flav has had various child support issues, often refusing to pay, but he has made an effort to be a bigger presence in his girls’ lives, posting numerous pictures with them on social media.</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>Da’Zyna Drayton&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>Da’Zyna</strong>, born Feb. 23, 1992, is Flav’s child he shares with <strong>Angie Parker</strong>, who he dated after Karen. According to Da’Zyna’s very active Instagram, she and her dad remain in each others’ good graces, as she posts numerous photos of them together. The two faced their difficulties back during the first season of Growing Up Hip Hop: New York&nbsp;when Da’Zyna <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>confronted her father</a> over his years of neglect and not paying child support for her growing up. “I know I’m all over the place, but I’m still that phone call away,” Flav said, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Source</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“Growing up was hard,” Da’Zyna said. “It was very hard. It was not fun half the time. I had to deal with bullies and fighting. I had bumps and bruises. You not being there and stuff…it was a lot.” She went on to tell her dad she was homeless at one point and explained how “hard” the situation was for her. Flav clearly took in the message, wiping tears from his eyes and seemingly spending a lot more time with his daughter afterward.</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>Quanah Drayton&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Like his sister, <strong>Quanah</strong> has also appeared on&nbsp;Growing Up Hip Hop: New York&nbsp;with his dad, and seems to be unafraid to step out in the spotlight. “I’m used to having them on TV with me, but now I get to be on TV with them,” Flav said <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>during a panel for the show</a> in 2019, speaking highly of his kids.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>According to Quanah’s Facebook, he’s also interested in following in his dad’s footsteps, noting in his bio that he’s an “artist,” adding a microphone and music notes emojis.</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>William Drayton&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flavor-Flav-Kids-ss-.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15><strong>William</strong>, Flav’s other son he shares with Angie, likes to keep things pretty low-key in his life, although he also appeared on Growing Up Hip Hop: New York <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>with his siblings</a>. Angie, like Karen, denounced Flav for neglecting his children, taking issue with the rapper <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>refusing to pay child support</a>. She also approached the court in 2014 for Flav to pay more than $111,186 in child support — an amount that had accrued over some time.</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>Karma Drayton&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-18><strong>Karma</strong> is Flav’s child he shares with his wife&nbsp;<strong>Liz Trujillo</strong>, whom he’s been with for quite some time. Flav and Liz have had their many <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ups and downs</a>, as Liz announced on a 2013 episode of Couples Therapy&nbsp;that she wasn’t aware of Flav signing his dating show contracts for&nbsp;Flavor of Love&nbsp;Seasons 1 and 2. They welcomed their son Karma in 2007, and Flav has shared many sweet photos of him and his son on social media.</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>Jordan&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-21><strong>Jordan</strong>, Flav’s youngest child, was born in 2019. The rapper shares the little boy with his former manager, <strong>Kate Gammell</strong>, who filed a paternity suit in 2019 in the Los Angeles County court. “Jordan is not getting any child support from Flavor, and I needed money for Jordan’s everyday needs,” Kate shared in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>HipHopDx</a> in 2019. “So, I decided to pull out the merch and sell it to help my son and give a percentage to Children’s Hospital.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>In May 2022, it was confirmed that Jordan is Flav’s son. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ </a>reported that a child support plan and custody agreement were put into place and that Flav had been spending some “quality time” with his youngest son. The publication also noted Jordan would be taking Flav’s last name.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8WlmK%2BnomKzra3VZqKinKNigXd8kXJobWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fflavor-flav-kids-4602914.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fflavor-flav-kids-4602914.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fflavor-flav-kids-4602914.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fflavor-flav-kids-4602914.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fflavor-flav-kids-4602914.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fflavor-flav-kids-4602914.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./farrah-abraham-arrested-for-dui.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./farrah-abraham-arrested-for-dui.html>Farrah Abraham: Arrested For DUI!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./vadym-cavaleras-girlfriend-list.html>Vadym Cavaleras Girlfriend: Who is Vadym Cavalera Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./vadym-cavaleras-girlfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
