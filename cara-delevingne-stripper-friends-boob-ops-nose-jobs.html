<time>09 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>SHE is Britain’s top-earning model, with striking looks and a glamorous lifestyle that is the envy of millions.</strong></p><p>Yet as well as the A-list friends, movie roles and deals with the biggest brands in fashion, Cara Delevingne has revealed that she has even more fun behind closed doors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000378325481.jpg><p>In a cheeky and daring interview, the catwalk superstar tells all about her wild sex life and opens up about her early experimentation, launching her own range of bedroom toys and her love of male strippers — despite being best known for her romances with other women.</p><p>And though Cara has one of the most famous and sought-after figures in the world, she adds that she hopes to get her breasts enhanced, after years of insecurity over her cleavage.</p><p>The 28-year-old beauty’s outspoken nature and new-found confidence has sparked much speculation about her sexuality — since she enjoyed high-profile relationships and rumoured flings with both men and women.</p><p>Her most serious recent relationship saw her date actress Ashley Benson for three years before reports that they had split last year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000018096251.jpg><p>She has also been linked to Elon Musk, Miley Cyrus, Michael Jackson’s daughter Paris and American actress Michelle Rodriguez.</p><p>Other rumoured romances included Rita Ora — who referred to Cara as her “wifey” — and Harry Styles, though the pair have played down speculation that they became more than friends.</p><p>But despite previously labelling herself “bisexual”, Cara now reveals that she is less sure of her exact sexual persuasion.</p><p>She says: “The way I define myself changes all the time. It’s like pansexual, bisexual, I don’t really know.</p><h2>FULL-FRONTAL</h2><p>“It’s quite interesting because I wasn’t allowed to be something, but it’s like a pendulum swinging. So now I feel far more comfortable being bisexual than I used to.</p><p>“I felt I was lacking in my desire for women, or love for women, that I kind of went one way, but it changes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6e12e3a0-2511-4ae1-8011-9316106b0361.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5e0b2bcd-63ff-4707-b66d-200296a592e3.jpg><p>“I feel a lot more free, more comfortable. Before, I was like, ‘I’m gay’, now it’s changed.”</p><p>She adds: “The problem is I shouldn’t be so quick to label myself because it changes all the time, or to be honest that it might still change.</p><p>“Even in the form of gender and identity, I am a woman, but I like to play the role of a man sometimes.</p><p>“That doesn’t mean I identify as anything other than a woman but it’s just understanding that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/084ead13-40fe-4717-b3ab-194be0840a17.jpg><p>And despite her sexual attraction to women in recent years, Cara says she is excited by male strippers — and regularly goes to shows.</p><p>Speaking on the Make It Reign podcast, she says: “Have you ever been to Magic Mike? It’s amazing. It’s honestly so hot, it was carnage.</p><p>“It’s an art. I was honestly blown away, just amazed. I got taken up on stage, I was having the best time.</p><p>“I was attached to the ropes, flying around in the air, it was so fun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000386025785.jpg><p>“Honestly, I prefer male strip clubs far more. There was one incredible one in Toronto, which was amazing. Canada is the only place you can have full-frontal male nudity, so you want to go there.</p><p>“I made friends with those strippers too, I just make friends wherever I go.”</p><p>And discussing her love of sex toys after unveiling her own collection, Lora DiCarlo, Cara says: “I’m taking away the stigma of orgasms. The big O, hopefully lots of orgasms, not just one.</p><p>“That’s what we guarantee every customer — multiple orgasms. The amount of friends who have got back in contact with me after so long to be like, ‘Thank you’, it’s been such a blessing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000412754132.jpg><p>Cara, who even admits pleasuring herself in a pool while a student, adds: “Couples as well as single people will enjoy these products, or just talking about sex in this way.</p><p>“It’s not trying to alienate men and women or how you identify, it’s about opening the conversation of self-pleasure and what it means to you.</p><p>“It’s so interesting when you start talking about sex and how many people find it unbelievably uncomfortable. Setting up Lora DiCarlo has made me take pride in my sexuality, 100 per cent.</p><p>“It’s really taking pride in my sexual identity, my sexuality and taking pride in my sexual needs as well, to take ownership of my orgasm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000520969817.jpg><p>“It’s so much easier to tell a partner what you want if you know what you want. We’re taught that men are hornier creatures — it’s just not true.</p><p>“It’s still there, just a bit more under the surface, but the needs are very much the same. We’re not taught to honour that, or think about that. It comes last, the pleasure part.</p><p>“The amount of times I’d have sex and that wasn’t even a thought — ‘Oh I could have an orgasm right now’ — it was just sex. That wasn’t even on the list of things during sex. It’s important to talk about these things.”</p><p>Despite Cara’s incredible confidence and success, which has seen her front global campaigns for brands including Burberry and DKNY, she tells of the emotional struggles she faced earlier in life as she came to terms with her body and sexuality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000637021626.jpg><p>At its worst, she even feared that homosexuality was a mental illness which she struggled to overcome.</p><p>She says: “The journey has obviously been a long one. I’ve struggled with it since I was a kid. It also comes from things like trauma and having addiction in my family.</p><p>“There are so many reasons why, instead of pointing the finger and going, ‘I’m sick’. I don’t take antidepressants, I try as much as I can to use the tools within me and not just think, ‘I’m sick and f***ed up’.</p><p>“Honestly, my whole life I thought being gay was a mental illness. I thought I was sick, I thought there was something wrong with me, being queer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/7e33584b-3cc2-4f91-927d-44e3f361f39c.jpg><p>“Any of those things. It was the same with depression. It’s OK to go through that, everyone does at some point. It’s being able to talk about it that’s given me the tools to find people to talk to about it.”</p><p>And after a raft of earlier insecurities, Cara has also found comfort within her own body — which she admits she has long hoped to enhance with plastic surgery.</p><h2>DEEP INSECURITY</h2><p>She adds: “If I have work done, I’ll talk about it. I find it really important for young girls, particularly at the moment, to have someone who would go and have something and then talk about it afterwards.</p><p>“It’s as if it’s frowned upon, because it comes from a place of deep insecurity.</p><p>"Ever since I was a kid I was like, ‘I want to have a boob job. My boobs are uneven. I don’t like my nose’. All these different things.</p><p>“I’ve got close to thinking about it but luckily in that moment I’ve gone, ‘Well, if I was to do it I don’t think I could be honest about it and then that would be a problem’.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/e32f1472-64cc-4137-8f73-bb08b8d4cc79.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000629444269.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>“I just think young girls and boys need to know that some things just aren’t naturally obtainable. Which is fine, that’s modern science, that’s OK. What makes it sad is people don’t talk about it.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“I can’t wait to have something done but I don’t know when that might be because I have to act. The problem is I can’t not move my face because that’s the only thing I have, to be able to move my face really weirdly and in different ways.</p><p>“I’d be worried I wouldn’t be able to do that.”</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Cara Delevingne strips off for a steamy sex scene with Orlando Bloom in supernatural series Carnival Row</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hrYWiDeX2PaJqaqpFisaa4xK%2Bgp5%2Bemnq0wNGip6mdomKzs7XEp5usZZKkvKN5zqmqZqafqLJuts6bqmg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcara-delevingne-stripper-friends-boob-ops-nose-jobs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcara-delevingne-stripper-friends-boob-ops-nose-jobs.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcara-delevingne-stripper-friends-boob-ops-nose-jobs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcara-delevingne-stripper-friends-boob-ops-nose-jobs.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcara-delevingne-stripper-friends-boob-ops-nose-jobs.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcara-delevingne-stripper-friends-boob-ops-nose-jobs.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./donna-roberts.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./donna-roberts.html>Donna Roberts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ronnie-dunns-wife-list.html>Ronnie Dunns Wife: Who is Ronnie Dunn Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ronnie-dunns-wife-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
