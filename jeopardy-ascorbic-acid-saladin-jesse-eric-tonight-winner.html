It’s ABCD"</p><p>"My thoughts exactly" replied another.</p><p>Another Reddit user wrote: “Shouldn't have given the returning champ the money for answering 'asorbic' acid."</p><p>Another argued: “Here, though, the presence of the 'c' sound doesn't have any actual bearing on whether or not 'ascorbic acid' fits the category."</p><p>A third wrote: “You're right--I just realized that the first c in 'ascorbic' has no bearing on the a-b-c-d thing, because it's either of the two c's after the b (and before the d) that is what's really required."</p><p>A fourth wrote: “But you still have a C following a B with 'asorbic acid.' - thinking that's why the contestant mispronounced it.</p><p>"In fact, I think Jesse intentionally pronounced it that way to avoid putting a C before the B.</p><p>""sc" can make an "s" sound in English. As long as your pronunciation doesn't necessitate a different spelling it is usually ruled correct," wrote another.</p><p>"That was just a dumb category, and hope it gets tossed in the categorical ashcan, bin, scrapheap or dumpster," wrote a fifth.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeopardy.com</a>: Responses "must be phonetically correct and not add or subtract any extraneous sounds or syllables."</p><h2>4TH NEW CHAMP THIS WEEK ALERT</h2><p>Jesse found all three Daily Doubles but missed both in the second round, so Rebecca led going into Final Jeopardy with $9,800, Eric had $6,800 and Jesse $3,000.</p><p>Under “Historical figures” Final Jeopardy read: "Dante gives him, born to a Kurdish family in the 12th century, a place of honor in limbo along with the war heroes of Rome & Troy.”</p><p>Only Eric was correct with "Saladin," - the former Sultan of Egypt.</p><p>He added a safe $800 to win $7,600 and looked thrilled as the crowd roared since he scored a nice comeback from second place.</p><p>"I'm glad that guy won" one Facebook user wrote: "Me too…they were so close. I love the suspense and the contestants were sweet."</p><p>However, it's been a <a href=#>low-scoring week</a> that's seen four 1-day winners and only two correct responses on <a href=#>Final Jeopardy total</a>- not much cash flow for anyone as a result.</p><h2>HIGH TURNAROUND AND LOW WINNINGS!</h2><p>In fact, some fans are streak-starved-there hasn't been a four-day winner <a href=#>since March</a>. And there have only been two three-day winners in over a month.</p><p>"This has been a week of low Final Jeopardy winnings and lots of new winners who don't stay long on the show!" one fan wrote to Reddit.</p><p>"I feel like ratings are going to drop if the show keeps up this way," another feared.</p><p>The last four-day winner was&nbsp;<a href=#>Stephen Webb whose eight-day streak ended on March 16</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Ben Chan bowed out after his third runaway win</a>, he did not compete on Monday, April 14 as scheduled, concerning fans- as he seemed like he was going to break the curse.</p><p>In a rare occurrence,&nbsp;<a href=#>there were three new contestants</a>&nbsp;instead and Ben will be returning to go for win four as the returning champ (<a href=#>of two</a>&nbsp;out of a technicality) on May 15's episode.</p><p>As for Ben, he later clarified&nbsp;<a href=#>the real reason he did not return as scheduled</a>.</p><p>“Before yesterday’s episode taped, I had tested positive for COVID; it was a very mild case, as you can see, I’m fine.</p><p>"Most importantly, my buzzer finger is fine, so I’m excited to watch what happens over the next few weeks, see who I’ll be competing against on May 15," he said during a virtual appearance on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Good Day Wisconsin</a>.</p><p>One fan responded when he tweeted out the story: "Looking forward to your return!"</p><p>The other three-day champ in the past month was the savvy truck driver services manager&nbsp;<a href=#>Brian Hennegar</a>, but otherwise, it's been a carousel of one or two-day winners and low scores.</p><p>In one rarity,<a href=#>&nbsp;1-day winner Devin Lohman won with $1.2K,</a>&nbsp;the lowest amount of the season after a triple stumper wiped everyone's scores.</p><p>He ended up with less takeaway than the contestant in second place's $2K consolation prize.</p><p>For reference, this time last year super-champion&nbsp;<a href=#>Mattea Roach</a>&nbsp;was in the midst of their 23-game winning streak.</p><p>Then came Ryan Long - and before them Amy Schneider and Matt Amodio, all during one deeply impressive season.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ken is hosting his final week of the season this week -&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>&nbsp;will return on May 1 and helm the last four months of the season.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>While she is doing so Ken will host&nbsp;<a href=#>Jeopardy!
