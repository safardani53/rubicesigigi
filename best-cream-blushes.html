After trying it out firsthand, we gave it perfect scores in all categories, including texture, blendability, and pigment.

We gave this blush stick perfect scores for texture and blendability, noting that it's light and creamy but doesn't feel sticky on your cheeks or fingertips.

This blush from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Selena Gomez's Rare Beauty</a> feels creamy on the fingertips and leaves behind a light flush of dewy color. And for how much dew it imparts, we were surprised to find that it doesn't leave much of a sticky residue behind, which is rare for blushes that promise a glass-skin look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a few pats of the finger, the Stay Vulnerable blush truly melts into the skin, and we loved the natural-looking flush of pigment that it left us with. We think that this product would fit well in any no-makeup-makeup routine because it gives a flushed, plump look to the cheeks. It's not the most pigmented blush that we tried, which is a positive for those going for a barely-there look, but might not work for someone who's looking for a super bright pop of color from their rouge. Overall, Selena's adorable compact blush is truly a treat!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades:</strong> 5 | <strong>Finish:</strong> Dewy | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.17 oz.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Tamara Staples</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cream-to-powder-victoria-beckham-beauty-cheeky-posh-cream-blush-stick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Cream-to-Powder</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Victoria Beckham Beauty Cheeky Posh Cream Blush Stick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=800 data-sizes=750px alt="Victoria Beckham Beauty Cheeky Posh Cream Blush Stick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Au9G4jlxLvvjdStJb2sYlqJbelI=/fit-in/1500x800/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/victoriabeckhambeautycheekyposhcreamblushstick-fee53ec347244a6fa609f49951629267.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Victoria Beckham Beauty</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>Dries to a natural, powder-like finish that's not at all drying</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Stick design makes it easy to touch-up on the go</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Easily blendable by using fingers or a damp sponge</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Stick-formula blushes are a convenient way to apply blush on the go and touch-up when you need to. This luxurious formula from Victoria Beckham Beauty is creamy and moisturizing without leaving an overly-dewy finish behind. In fact, after testing this blush out in our labs, we'd describe its finish as closer to a powder than a cream, although it's not at all drying as some true powders can be. The packaging is sleek and perfect for slipping in your purse and was easy to apply directly onto the cheeks with the help of fingers or a damp sponge to blend out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This product's pigment starts out quite natural upon first application, but we found that it was easy to build up for a more blush-centric look without any clinging or streaking. With the texture of a cream and the finish of a powder, this blush truly does offer the best of both worlds! This is one of the pricier options on our list, but we think that the packaging and formula really do live up to the luxury feel that the price tag denotes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades:</strong> 5 | <strong>Finish:</strong> Matte | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.17 oz.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Tamara Staples</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-when-buying-cream-blush></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider When Buying Cream Blush</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Shade</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Similar to shopping for a good <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>long-lasting lipstick</a>, the most important thing to consider when buying cream blush is the shade. Some people like to have multiple options on-hand to go with different outfits or makeup looks, but certain colors may complement your complexion more than others.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"For deeper skin tones, I recommend brighter shades like reds, plums, and peachy-orange tones," says Dedivanovic.

Some cream blushes, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Makeup By Mario Soft Pop Blush Stick</a>, offer full-color payoff in one or two dabs, and others may require multiple swipes. However, Dedivanovic says, "Don't be too intimidated by color when it comes to cream blushes, as most will apply a bit softer than they appear in the packaging."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Finish</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You'll also want to think about whether you want a dewy, matte, radiant, slightly shimmery, or natural-looking finish. This is mostly a matter of preference, though it's important to note that luminous cream blushes are often preferred for a full-glam effect, and natural finishes, like the finish of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Rare Beauty Stay Vulnerable Melting Cream Blush</a>, are ideal for that no-makeup makeup look.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Blendability</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Blendability is also key. Cream blushes containing hydrating ingredients tend to glide more easily onto the skin. Whether with a brush, a makeup sponge, or your fingertips, they should buff seamlessly with minimal streaks. According to Dedivanovic, sheer formulas are ideal because they're easiest to blend and offer a more natural-looking flush.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People/Tamara Staples</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested-cream-blushes></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested Cream Blushes</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tried 28 cream blushes in our PEOPLE Tested lab to determine the best options on the market.

Cream or liquid blush glides onto the skin easily and helps you achieve a more subtle, no makeup look. They also tend to be less pigmented than powder which makes them buildable and harder to overdo. Usually containing conditioning ingredients, cream blush is better for those with dry or mature skin. On the other hand, powder blush has more staying power, especially in the hotter weather, and is mattifying. However, using a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>face primer</a> can help a cream blush last longer. In the end, it is a personal preference and can depend on the season and the look you want.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do you apply cream blush before or after setting powder?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Apply your cream blush before setting powder.
