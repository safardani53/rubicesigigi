He was 25 years old. “It is with the heaviest Eddy Chen/HBOheart that we had to say goodbye to an incredible human today,” his family began in a statement to TMZ. “As an artist, a friend, a brother and a son, Angus was special to all of us in so many ways. Last week he buried his father and intensely struggled with this loss. The only comfort we have is knowing Angus is now reunited with his dad, who was his best friend.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>His family addressed his mental health issues in the statement as well, although they did not explicitly say his struggles were the cause of his death. “We hope that his passing can be a reminder to others that they are not alone and should not fight this on their own in silence,” they said. “We hope the world remembers him for his humor, laughter and love for everyone,” they continued, wrapping up the statement. “We ask for privacy at this time as we are still processing this devastating loss.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Euphoria-Stars-React-Angus-Cloud-Death-HBO-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Angus played Fezco on Euphoria between 2019 and 2022, and the character served as his breakout role. He also appeared in a handful of music videos, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>. In 2019, <strong>Javon “Wanna”</strong> <strong>Walton</strong>, who plays Ashtray on the show, compared his real-life bond with Angus to their characters’ strong friendship. “In Euphoria, they [Ashtray and Fezco] would die for each other,” <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY</a>. “They’re that close, and I feel like we do a good job of showing that.” Read on to see the tributes his co-stars left him, including Javon.</p><h2><strong>Hunter Schafer</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>Hunter Schafer</strong>, Angus’ co-star who plays Jules Vaughn on Euphoria, took to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, two days after his death was announced, to share a smiling photo of her late friend and a loving caption. “been trying to figure out what to say, but idk if any combination of words can articulate all of the big feelings. for now i just wanna say: Angus was a sunshine. to have known his warmth, his light, and his love was nothing short of a gift,” she wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“i’m so grateful to have shared so many enormous fits of laughter, so many sweet moments, and the joy of getting to make something together that we loved so much,” she continued. “i love you angus 💗 thank you for everything. my heart goes out to his family and all of his loved ones right now.”</p><h2><strong>Dominic Fike</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>Dominic Fike</strong>, who acted alongside Angus in Euphoria‘s second season, seemed to pay tribute to him during a concert in Houston, TX on August 1. In a video captured of the touching moment, which can be seen<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> here</a>, the actor and musician didn’t mention Angus by name, but told the crowd he lost a friend “recently” and explained how his grief has been a “weird” experience since it’s the first time he’s lost someone he knows “well enough to cry over.” He also revealed he was about to get a massage right before he heard the tragic news and ended up not going through with it because it felt “stupid” and “trivial.” He ended his emotional speech by saying Angus had a “spark” that “would light up a room” before admitting he initially hesitated on playing the show that night, but ultimately felt his late friend would have wanted him to go forward with it.</p><h2><strong>Javon “Wanna”</strong> <strong>Walton</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Javon, who clearly has a special place in his heart for Angus, shared a throwback picture (seen <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>HERE</a>) of them hugging on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to honor the late star. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“rest easy brother,”</a> he wrote in the caption.

The photo showed Angus posing in plaid shorts and a matching blazer at the Revolve Social Club in Los Angeles in 2022, similar to the outfit above.</p><h2>Kathrine Narducci</h2><p id=content-paragraph-20><strong>Kathrine Narducci</strong>, who played the grandmother of Angus’ character of Fezco during Season 2 of the show, took to her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> feed to share a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>selfie</a> with him and express her heartbreak. “@anguscloud what a shining light . Kind , one of a kind . Rest peace,” she said.</p><h2>Sam Levinson</h2><p id=content-paragraph-21>“There was no one quite like Angus.

He also struggled, like many of us, with addiction and depression,” Euphoria creator <strong>Sam Levinson </strong>told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in a statement on July 31. “I hope he knew how many hearts he touched.
