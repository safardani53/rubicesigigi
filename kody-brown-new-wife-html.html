Look at everything you've overcome. Don't give up now," fuelling speculation of a marital split.</p><p>But even after the legal separation being showcased in the television program, fans of Sister Wives questioned whether the onscreen drama was real or fake.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, during an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">April 2018 interview</a>, Kody confirmed their divorce was legitimate, saying he did not want to be in an intimate relationship with Meri. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Fast-forward to 2021, and their relationship had taken a different turn.
