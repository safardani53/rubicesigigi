Call The Sun Online on 0207 782 4369 or email <a href=#>exclusive@the-sun.co.uk</a></strong></p><p>Police confirmed the <a href=#>dog </a>was destroyed at the scene to "ensure the safety of the public".</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more news">Read more news</h2><p>A second dog - also an <a href=#>XL Bully</a> - was seized from the property as a precaution.</p><p>Police are now looking into claims the dog had attacked others on the estate before the fatal attack.</p><p>Ian's friend Janice Gonzales she she was aware of two other victims but believes there could be more.</p><p>A spokesperson for Northumbria Police said: "We are aware of comments about concerns previously being reported to police in relation to dogs in Shiney Row, Sunderland.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>“We can confirm we will be reviewing these reports.”</p><p>It comes as tributes continue to flood in for dad-of-one Ian, who was with his Patterdale terrier puppy Beau when the <a href=#>dog</a> attacked.</p><p>Friend Rachael Barron, 31, said: "It's absolutely devastating that<br>this has happened to him, he is a lovely, kind man.</p><p>"He's very slight of build and could not hurt a fly, he would have<br>stood no chance against a dog as big as that, it makes me feel sick to<br>think about it.</p><p>"I don't know exactly what has happened but if another dog was trying to get at Beau, Scouse would have done anything to protect him.</p><p>"We have been devastated, I haven't even been able to tell the kids<br>yet, they will be so upset. Everyone knew and liked him, he was a<br>lovely guy.</p><p>"He didn't work but spent all his time with Beau or helping out in<br>people's allotments. He just liked to be around people."</p><p>Another pal added: "He didn’t deserve to die.</p><p>“He was a canny lad. He was friendly. It’s a tragedy.”</p><p>Horrified locals told how police told them to stay indoors as officers stormed the residential street last night.</p><p>Neighbour Linda Blyth, 56, said she then heard a "loud crack" as the animal was shot dead.</p><p>She added: "It seems as though the man was trying to get his puppy out of the way when the XL Bully took hold of him.</p><p>"It's the most awful thing I've seen."</p><p>One witness said there was "so much blood" following the savage attack as the animal went for Ian's throat.</p><p>Locals also claimed the XL Bully had been reported in the past for attacking other dogs.</p><p>The <span id=032c30a4-4c19-4968-af6c-730fd559cd42 class=suggested-link>horror</span> is the latest in a <a href=#>spate of dog attacks</a> across the UK.</p><p>It also comes amid a growing public debate after <a href=#>Rishi Sunak</a>&nbsp;vowed to ban <a href=#>American bully XL</a> <span id=0fd844eb-cf41-424c-98ba-dee2ba83cd12

Inspector Angela Hudson, of Northumbria Police, said: “First and foremost, I would like to extend my sincere condolences to the man’s family and loved ones.</p><p>“This is an absolutely tragic incident, and we will continue to offer them support in any way that we can.</p><p>“A full investigation has been launched to determine the circumstances of what has happened.</p><p>“I would like to reassure the wider community that there is no ongoing risk to them, and officers will remain in the area to offer reassurance and carry out enquiries.</p><p>“While our investigation is at an early stage, we do believe those involved were known to each other.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“I would also continue to ask people not to speculate about the incident online, including on social media, while enquiries are ongoing.”</p><p>Anyone with information on the latest incident has been asked to call police on
