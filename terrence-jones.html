Jones’s parents were not very well-off, but they did everything to cheer up.&nbsp;</p><p>Terrence grew up in the same city he was born and attended Thomas Jefferson High School in Portland.</p><p>He began playing basketball at the same school. Jones was a bit strong and athletic since childhood, so he did well in extra-curricular activities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jones-with-his-parents-and-his-friend-Terrence-Ross.jpg><p>Over time, his interest in basketball games rose considerably. As his cousins had already gained some popularity as basketball players at that time, he, too, began seeing dreams of achieving something great in basketball.</p><p>His cousins, Damon and Salim Stoudamire, are both former NBA players. Damon currently works as an assistant coach of the famous NBA club, Boston Celtics.</p><p>Terrence’s parents, too, supported him in following his ambitions. As a result, he would often engage in basketball games with his friends in the locality during his spare time.</p><p>He attended the University of Kentucky (UK) after his graduation in 2010 to continue his studies and pursue his college career.</p><h2>Terrence Jones | Career</h2><h3>High School Career</h3><p>Terrence played his high school basketball for the Thomas Jefferson High School in Portland, Oregon. He had enrolled in that school as a kid and progressed into the high school basketball team.</p><p>He enjoyed playing in the power forward position from the beginning and performed very well. His enormous stature proved a huge plus point for him to dominate the game, and he had outstanding high school records.</p><p>One of his several contributions was leading the Jefferson to the Oregon class 5A state championship three times.</p><p>His performance in his junior and senior seasons marked his drastic progress. Hence, he won many honors, including being named in the Junior National Select Team, which competed in the 2010 Nike Hoop Summit.</p><p>He averaged over 30.0 points and 10.0 points per game in both the last high school seasons. In addition, he was included in the team to play in the McDonald’s All-American Game in 2010.</p><p><a href=#><strong>&nbsp;Allonzo Trier Bio: Mother, Drug Test, NBA & Net Worth >></strong></a></p><h3>College Career</h3><p>After graduating high school, he initially thought of joining the University of Washington. <a href=#>Terrence Ross</a>, his childhood friend, and the famous NBA player encouraged him to join him there.</p><p>However, he abandoned it and joined the University of Kentucky instead. Jones played all 38 matches of his rookie season and had terrific stats. He averaged 15.7 points and 8.8 rebounds per game that season.</p><p>In like manner, he got a chance to play in all games of the season as he had won over the trust of his team with his performance throughout the first season.</p><p>Terrence was previously thinking of forgoing his college season after his first season, but he stayed.</p><p>He continued his top-class game as a sophomore and averaged 12.3 points per game, playing 38 matches. He led the Kentucky Wildcats to the NCAA championship in the same season.</p><p>After the second season, Terrence decided to leave his college and entered the 2012 NBA draft.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>The Houston Rockets chose Jones as the 2012 NBA draft’s first-round 8th pick. That year’s draft was the most memorable one for the Wildcats, as six players from their team made it into the NBA that year.</p><p>Following his recruitment, Terrence played some matches in the NBA Development League and became one of its best performers. However, he did not get much playtime as a rookie.</p><p>He appeared in just 19 regular season matches in which he averaged 5.5 points and 3.7 rebounds per game. The club entrusted him with more matches in the second season.</p><p>Terrence started 71 out of 74 matches that season, averaging 12.1 points per game.</p><p>He played two more seasons for the Rockets but with very miserable scores. In addition, he suffered a series of injuries, including a concussion and an eye injury which forced him out of the court for many matches.</p><p>To make the matter worse, he had an accident and was bedridden for several days.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Terrence-Jones-in-the-New-Orleans-Pelicans-jersey.jpg><p>The Rockets shifted him to the New Orleans Pelicans in 2016. He showed some signs of improvement in the 2016-17 season, but they eventually transferred him to the Milwaukee Bucks in the next season.</p><p>After returning from the Chinese Basketball League, he briefly played for the Houston Rockets again in the 2018-19 season. Additionally, Jones played for the Chinese club Qingdao Eagles of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) in 2017.</p><p>Moreover, he played for the TNT KaTropa in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) in 2019. In addition, he has played in a few other foreign leagues as well.</p><p>Terrence has recently joined the Grand Rapids Gold, an affiliate club of the Denver Nuggets, to play in the NBA G League.</p><h2>Terrence Jones | Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Some of his awards and achievements include:</p><ul><li>NCAA champion (2012)</li><li>McDonald’s All-American (2010)</li><li>SEC Rookie of The Year (2011)</li><li>SEC All-Rookie Team (2011)</li><li>PBA Best Import of the Conference (2019)</li><li>First-team All-SEC (2011)</li><li>First-team Parade All-American (2010)</li></ul><h2>Net Worth, Salary & Career Earnings</h2><p>According to sources, Terrence Jones has an estimated net worth of around $1-$5 million.</p><p>He has earned an enormous amount of money through the NBA league games.
