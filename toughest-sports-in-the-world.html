Cross-country Running</h3><p>If you’re searching for a sport that would best test your mental strength and endurance, then Cross-country running is the sport you might consider looking at.</p><p>This sport will undoubtedly test your every ounce of physical and mental ability.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Crosscountryus.jpg><p>Talking about its challenges, this sport challenges you mentally and physically to endure long, daunting miles in the day’s scorching sun.</p><p>This isn’t the only difficulty runners face; they also face different health issues like a muscle tears, ligament damage, blurry vision, fatigue, muscle cramps, and physical injury.</p><p>When it comes to Cross-country running, health issues aren’t the only difficulties runners face. As in this sport, weather plays a big part in determining the problem.</p><p>Not to mention, races are scheduled on random days regardless of the weather condition.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes runners are seen running on extremely sunny days, whereas sometimes, they run in wet and muddy fields.</p><p>So, without a doubt, Cross-country running is one of the most challenging sports in the world.&nbsp;</p><h3>9. Freestyle Wrestling</h3><p>If you imagine Freestyle wrestling with WWE wrestling, let us correct you.</p><p>Freestyle wrestling is a combat sport where two opponents go against each other to pin each other down on an octagonal mat inside a circle.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Freestyle-wrestling-scaled.jpg><p>Moreover, freestyle wrestling is a physically demanding sport that requires immense strength and techniques.</p><p>To clarify, this form of wrestling brings together traditional wrestling, judo, and&nbsp;sambo&nbsp;techniques.</p><p>Besides, we can also see it being contested in the Olympic Games.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, Freestyle wrestling can also be practiced in American high schools as a sport.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as expected from all forms of physical sport, wrestling also has a high chance of internal and bodily injury.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Tito Trinidad Bio: Wrestling Career, Net Worth & Parents>></strong></a></p><h3>8. Figure Skating</h3><p>Figure Skating is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful forms of sport.</p><p>A form of sport that is widely loved and admired by many. However, as beautiful and elegant as it is, it is equally difficult to perform and master.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Ekaterina-Gordeeva-and-Sergei-Grinkov-.jpg><p>Figure skating is a form of ice sport that can be done individually, in pairs, or in groups.</p><p>The athletes are supposed to perform elegant and beautiful dances, acrobatics, and skating to please the crowds and the judges.&nbsp;</p><p>Not to forget, all this happens on top of the ice. The figure skater has to find their balance on top of this slippery solid surface on a four-millimeter-thick blade performing all the moves and maneuvers.&nbsp;</p><p>Without a doubt, figure skating is a challenging and injury-prone sport. Similarly, this sport is also highly competitive.</p><p>This sport is more complex and mentally challenging with highly talented competitors and rivals.&nbsp;</p><p>So, the athlete must take utmost care and take every step with an intuitive sense to perfectly coordinate their balance and movements.</p><p>A mistake isn’t an option here because a plain error would result in a brutal fall and injury.&nbsp;</p><h3>7. Horseback Riding</h3><p>Our 7th ranking most challenging sport in the world is horseback riding. Originally named Equestrianism, horseback riding is a sport that consists of riding discipline, partnership, trust, and hard work.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, as the name suggests, this sport includes practice, display, and competition horses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Horseback-riding-e1644377991603.jpg><p>In other words, it is a team sport, but unlike other sports where you team up with humans, you’re teaming up with a horse. As a result, this sport tests your patience, dedication, and trust in your horse.&nbsp;</p><p>No wonder this sport is considered one of the most challenging sports globally.</p><p>On the contrary, this sport also includes steeplechasing with horses. The jockey needs to build trust, discipline, and a sense of coordination with their horse. By doing this, one could perform well in events and competitions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=#>Top 13 Famous Polo Athletes in the World>></a></strong></p><h3>6. Motocross</h3><p>Initially developed from moto trials, Motocross sport is motorcycle racing held on enclosed off-road circuits.</p><p>Not to mention, it is a very physically demanding and competitive sport.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Racing-Sport-Motorsport-Motocross-Motorcycle-Bike-e1644385867417.jpg><p>Here, riders must face off against each other in off-road circuits with many pathway twists, turns, and elevations.</p><p>The soil is sometimes sandy and sometimes muddy, making it equally difficult for riders to maneuver in such terrain.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, it takes a lot of experience, mental focus, and physical ability to finish the round.&nbsp;</p><p>However, some riders use PED for better performance during the match. But, using PED is strictly illegal and can result in severe consequences.</p><p>But, despite all the difficulties and obstacles, it is undoubtedly among the most fun to watch.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, if this sport weren’t to be hard, it wouldn’t have ended up in the most challenging sports in the world listing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=#>Austin Dillon: Racing Career, Movies & Injury>></a></strong></p><h3>5. Bull Riding</h3><p>As fun as it is to watch, Bull riding is an equally dangerous and challenging sport with many risks.</p><p>It takes a lot of courage and will to participate in this sport. No wonder Bull riding is considered one of the most challenging sports globally.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bull-Riding2-Szmurlo-e1644390789170.jpg><p>You would have to mount a 2000-pound bucking bull and attempt to stay mounted while the animal tries to throw you off.</p><p>It is a hazardous sport, with accidents and injuries unavoidable.&nbsp;</p><p>‘There is a reason this sport is called “the most dangerous eight seconds in sports.”</p><p>Given this, Bull riding is not for faint-hearted ones. Just imagine trying to keep your balance on top of a wild beast.</p><p>Not to mention, the beast is many times larger and stronger than you. Also, your opponent is an animal, not a human.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as risky as the sport, it attracts millions of viewers and attracts attention and viewers. So, despite its risk, it is one booming sport that is super popular worldwide.&nbsp;</p><h3>4. Water Polo</h3><p>Ever imagined swimming for 28 minutes? Imagine playing a kind of hand version of football in a swimming pool for 28 minutes.</p><p>Yes, as tiring as the game is, it is considered among the most challenging sports in the world.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/RIAN_archive_8772_Hungary_vs_Holland_water_polo_match.jpg><p>Talking about the sport, it is a competitive team water sport played between two teams with seven players on each team.</p><p>Each side attempts to score goals by throwing the ball inside the opponent’s goalpost.&nbsp;</p><p>Winners are decided on the number of goals each side scores. Moreover, the game is divided into four quarters, each quarter being 7 minutes long.</p><p>Between 7 minutes, there is a 2-minute interval. Hard, isn’t it?&nbsp;</p><p>It is the one sport you don’t often see people playing because of how hard it is. Hence, making its way into today’s ranking.&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Swimming</h3><p>Most of us already know how tough swimming can be, especially the competitive ones.</p><p>Else, it wouldn’t have been ranked 3rd in the most challenging sports in the world ranking.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mack-during-his-swimming-tenure.png><p>Moreover, this sport is played on an individual or group level.

It is performed in pools or open waters.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, it is trendy in the Olympics. It consists of different styles and category races like backstroke, freestyle, individual medley, butterfly, and breaststroke.</p><p>It is a very tiring and challenging sport, as swimmers are tested for their strength, endurance, and skills.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides, swimmers are prone to injuries like muscle tearing, cramps, dislocation, and drowning.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Gymnastics</h3><p>Ranked 2nd in today’s raking, Gymnastics was sure to make a list, with the complexity and difficulties it consists of.</p><p>Moreover, it is a form of acrobatic sport that consists of physical fitness and exercise, which requires flexibility, agility, strength, balance, coordination, endurance, and dedication.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2018-10-12_Gymnastics_at_2018_Summer_Youth_Olympics-scaled.jpg><p>Not to mention, <a href=#>Gymnastics</a> is very good for our health and physical well-being since it contributes to the growth and development of arms, legs, back, chest, shoulders, and muscles development.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides, the ancient Greeks used to use Gymnastics for exercise.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, Gymnastics is very popular in the Olympics and other renowned international competitions.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, Gymnastics can be practiced for recreation or well-being. It is a beautiful sport that is equally beneficial for our health.&nbsp;</p><h3>1. Boxing</h3><p>Boxing is number one on today’s list as the toughest and one of the world’s riskiest sports.&nbsp;</p><p>To clarify, this sport consists of two opponents fighting against each other in a ring to knock out each other and gain points by landing the most hits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Boxing.jpg><p>When it comes to Boxing, landing hits isn’t the only thing in play.
