The episode often chronicles the first 48 hours of the detectives’ investigation, following the premise that suspects must be identified within 48 hours; otherwise, the odds of solving the crime are slashed in half.</p><p>And, when the program takes viewers inside detailed crime scenes, the show’s official website states that the setting, the characters, and the investigations are all true. However, the internet is split on the subject.&nbsp;Some think the presentation is genuine, while others remain skeptical.</p><h2>Is It True That The First 48 Hours Existed?</h2><p>According to reports, the First 48 is as genuine as it gets. Several persons associated with the programs have come forward to back up the assertion.&nbsp;A former producer and photographer for the show started a Reddit topic for an AMA session in 2012. The guy who kept his name hidden said in the post that it was “the REALEST” docu-series he has ever done.</p><p>He maintained that no other TV show could claim itself a real Verte (a production term standing for Truth.) Working on the cases, he claimed, had a significant influence on his life.&nbsp;The crimes made him understand that even if he solved all of his difficulties, he would still be unable to account for some of the troubles other people faced out there. He’d be thankful for the tranquility he’d found in his life with his children, wife, and work.</p><p>Furthermore, the former crew member revealed how he had previously been close to a victim’s family. According to his statements, the victim revealed his birthdate and the automobile. Perhaps he inserted himself into the case because of the parallels.&nbsp;The victim’s father would phone him and express his displeasure. He even attended all of her funerals and burials. “It was the most I wept during filming,” he said.&nbsp;In the same forum, the individual commented on the show’s procedures, confirming that everything was true. He said that not every member of the family chooses to appear on television.&nbsp;According to him, if they didn’t sign a release form, the production crew couldn’t expose their identities. As a result, they distort the picture of such persons.</p><h2>‘The Failed Investigations of the First 48’</h2><p>While the program seeks to solve the crime in 48 hours, there have been several complaints that it puts undue pressure on police agencies to expedite their investigations. As a result, the reality docu-series has broadcast a number of situations in which individuals have been wrongfully accused of crimes.</p><p>Cameron Coker, for example, was wrongfully charged and sentenced to jail when he was 18 years old. After witnesses refuted the charges, he was imprisoned for over three years.&nbsp;Taiwan Smart was sentenced to prison for two counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of his two housemates. His tale was shown on television, and he gained notoriety. However, it was eventually shown that the investigators had made significant errors. In June of 2011, Smart was released.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>The First 48</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>The First 48 Show</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifnqqVqHq1tMRmq6utpJ16oq7OrqtmrJiaeqW7wq5krJ2inrK0edOhnGaemafAtXmTcWY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-the-truth-about-the-docu-series-the-first-48.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fheres-the-truth-about-the-docu-series-the-first-48.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fheres-the-truth-about-the-docu-series-the-first-48.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fheres-the-truth-about-the-docu-series-the-first-48.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-the-truth-about-the-docu-series-the-first-48.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-the-truth-about-the-docu-series-the-first-48.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./keith-colburn-wife-divorce.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./keith-colburn-wife-divorce.html>Reason Behind Keith Colburn And Ex Wife Florences Divorce</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./durham-smythe-usqw-html.html>Durham Smythe (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./durham-smythe-usqw-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
