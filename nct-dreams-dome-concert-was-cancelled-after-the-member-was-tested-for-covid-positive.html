It was a three-night sold-out event at Seoul‚Äôs Gocheok Sky Dome.&nbsp;The arrival of Renjun comes only two days after another member, Mark, tested positive for the virus. Initially, the agency opted to continue the show without him. However, it has now been completely scrapped. According to the agency, Renjun received all three doses of the vaccination. The message also said that, despite the staff and members‚Äô best efforts to put on a wonderful concert, the ‚Äúunavoidable choice‚Äù had to be taken. The show‚Äôs tickets will also be fully refunded.</p><h2>Renjun of NCT DREAM is the latest member to sign with COVID, and the agency has canceled Dome shows.</h2><p>Renjun, 22, is the most recent NCT DREAM member to test positive for COVID. On July 27, the singer got ‚Äústrange symptoms‚Äù and promptly utilized a self-test kit. He underwent PCR testing after obtaining a positive result. The outcomes were the same. As a result, the idol instantly ceased his actions. He is now quarantined.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NCT-DREAM-1.jpg alt="NCT DREAM" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The agency noted in a statement announcing the cancellation:</p><p>‚ÄúDespite the fact that all of the NCT DREAM members and staff worked hard to prepare a concert that would live up to the expectations of the fans who had been waiting for this concert, we regretfully came to the unavoidable conclusion that we would not be able to put on the best possible concert within the current situation, so we ask for fans‚Äô deep and generous understanding.‚Äù</p><p>Renjun is the latest in a long line of K-pop celebrities to cancel or postpone performances after acquiring the illness.&nbsp;While Zico postponed his return promotions, Yuta from NCT 127 had to miss Singapore‚Äôs concert, ENHYPEN‚Äôs Jay, Jake, and Heeseung, Cosmic Girls‚Äô Exy and Yeoreum, and others were recently diagnosed with COVID.&nbsp;SM Entertainment has canceled the group‚Äôs scheduled Dome performance due to obvious health issues. THE DREAM SHOW 2: IN A DREAM was a three-night event held at the Gocheok Sky Dome from July 29 to July 31.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NCT-DREAM-3.jpg alt="NCT DREAM" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Fans cry and offer heartfelt notes to Renjun and Mark.</h2><p>The now-canceled Dome tour was very important to NCT DREAM. It was the band‚Äôs first solo performance in South Korea in over three years. Furthermore, it would have been the group‚Äôs debut performance with all seven members.&nbsp;The group‚Äôs most recent concert, which was also their first, took place in 2019 with six members. Mark had left the organization in January of that year. Mark‚Äôs debut concert with NCT DREAM would have been on the Dome tour.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>i hope mark and renjun don‚Äôt blame themselves and just focus on healing and getting well ‚òπÔ∏è the road may have been bumpy but i‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll all be well soon. their hardworks will never be put into waste. we will wait for you, our 7dream! ü§ç <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/HR7QBMG4DW</a></p><p>‚Äî 41 (@haelovs) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">July 27, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>this is all so sad but i hope renjun and mark know that it is not their fault i hope they recover very very fast and be healthy again i dont want them to say sorry</p><p>‚Äî Ÿë (@monotgk) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">July 27, 2022</a></p><p>Fans were naturally upset as a result of multiple mishaps and the show being canceled.

Furthermore, they may still be able to play at the Seoul Festa 2022 next month. Meanwhile, NCT DREAM just announced the repackaged album Beatbox, which will be released on May 30, 2022.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>K-Pop Group</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>NCT DREAM</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGilnKxdmb%2BmrcysZJ2nnZp6pLvNnJyrrF2srrR5wpqlnJ2cobKlecCfq56qXam1pnnMnqSbnaJixKK%2FjK2crKyVmXqnu9FmmqiumZl6sbvSoquirpVk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnct-dreams-dome-concert-was-cancelled-after-the-member-was-tested-for-covid-positive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnct-dreams-dome-concert-was-cancelled-after-the-member-was-tested-for-covid-positive.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnct-dreams-dome-concert-was-cancelled-after-the-member-was-tested-for-covid-positive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnct-dreams-dome-concert-was-cancelled-after-the-member-was-tested-for-covid-positive.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnct-dreams-dome-concert-was-cancelled-after-the-member-was-tested-for-covid-positive.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnct-dreams-dome-concert-was-cancelled-after-the-member-was-tested-for-covid-positive.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./travis-scott-stated-that-he-will-provide-worth-1-million-scholarships-to-100-students.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./travis-scott-stated-that-he-will-provide-worth-1-million-scholarships-to-100-students.html>Travis Scott Stated That He Will Provide Worth $1 million Scholarships To 100 Students</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./23-photos-of-a-terrible-mother.html>Kate Gosselin: 32 Photos of a Terrible Mother</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./23-photos-of-a-terrible-mother.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
