Sharn runs local dog grooming business Jacko’s Fluff Your Pups.</p><p>Jason told The Sun when we visited: “People were always nicking the sign. One day there was Ainsley Harriet stickers on there and we had no idea why.&nbsp;</p><p>“We just moved here because we needed somewhere to live to move from Germany, we just picked it out and moved here.</p><p>"We did think it was an unusual name but had no idea about all the fuss.</p><p>“In Germany there were many unusually named places so we didn’t bat an eyelid. It is a great place to live, it is nice and quiet.”</p><p>Apart from its sign, the most popular Wetwang attraction is the fish and chip shop - Deep Blue - which has a constant queue outside.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/picture-village-wetwang-east-yorkshire-831068256.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/picture-village-wetwang-east-yorkshire-830407644.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/picture-village-wetwang-east-yorkshire-830407786.jpg><p>Brother and sister Hubert, 19, and Saffron Nickolls, 21, have recently moved from the village to nearby Beverley but come back daily for their job at the chippy.</p><p>Saffron said: “Everyone takes the Mick when you say you live here, but we don’t mind.</p><p>"I didn’t even realise it was rude until I got older. Even now I think it’s just a funny word rather than something rude."</p><p>The first rude definition of the unusual place name was used in a book called The Meaning of Liff - a dictionary of “things there aren’t words for yet”, using existing place names as the entry words.</p><p>It was written by Douglas Adams and John Lloyd, of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy fame, and says Wetwang means wet penis.</p><p>I didn’t even realise it was rude until I got older.

It also has a cricket club, a garage, a doctor’s surgery, a church and an annual scarecrow festival.</p><p>But residents moan not very much happens here - apart from it being on the route taking day trippers and staycationers from West Yorkshire to the east coast.</p><p>Saffron said: “We’ve lived here since we were six and eight so we’re used to it. It is a really lovely village with a fab fish and chip shop, but not so great when you’re growing up.</p><p>"There is only one bus stop and not a good bus service, you have to rely on people for lifts to go anywhere.</p><p>“We couldn’t get into the local primary school so had to travel to nearby Driffield. The high school is there too.</p><p>“The worst thing is there is no local shop so you can’t even nip out for a loaf of bread. It was brilliant when I learnt to drive a car and got some freedom.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/live-britains-rudest-town-selfish-831696186.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/picture-village-wetwang-east-yorkshire-830407600-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/picture-village-wetwang-east-yorkshire-830407520-1.jpg><p>Wetwang newcomer Paul Banks, 69, has only been in the village for six weeks, having moved from Hull into a council house with his dog, Jasper.</p><p>But he is finding the move from city to village hard. He said: “There is nothing to do here, there isn’t even a local shop. Although Jasper likes it, he’s having a great time.”</p><p>Frank Wilson, a father-of-three who is on the parish council and has lived in the village for 48 years, said: “I always thought the name was amusing rather than rude. I suppose it’s only become rude in the past 20 years or so.</p><p>“It’s great because wherever you go in the world, if you say you’re from Wetwang, everyone has heard of it.</p><p>“My daughter lives next door and so I also get to share this lovely community life with my grandchildren.</p><p>"It is an idyllic place to live, over the years we’ve had chickens, goats and sheep.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/picture-village-wetwang-east-yorkshire-830407739.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/picture-village-wetwang-east-yorkshire-830407728.jpg><p>Retired barrister Anthony Granville Fall, who has been chairman of the council for three months, is a proud Wetwanger.&nbsp;</p><p>The 70-year-old grandfather-of-two, who has emphysema, said: “There are a lot of good people in Wetwang. I am proud of our village - not just because of its name, but the fish shop brings people from far and wide. We are well known for that.</p><p>“We are just 25 minutes away from the coast and people love to stop by on their way to Bridlington.</p><p>“It was wonderful when we had Richard Whiteley as our mayor here, we had a lot of respect for him and he loved his title. It was great for the village.</p><p>“There is currently a planning application going through for a further 80 houses to be built here, so that will increase our population from 750 to 1000.</p><p>"It is to be hoped we will get a shop at that point.
