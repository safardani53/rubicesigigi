Mainly because it can trigger reactions and that's not a risk I'm willing to take any more.</p><p>"I'm 31 now, and I'm considering starting a family. I don't want these alien substances to be floating around in my bloodstream and in my skin cells and all that stuff — I want to be as clear of that as possible."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Reality</h2></p><p>The star, who exited the show in 2020, also added that she doesn't feel as pressured to look perfect now that she's stepped away from the cameras.</p><p>Louise has also had some teeth work done leaving them noticeably straighter and much whiter.</p><h2>Sam Thompson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sam-thompson-1.jpg><p>Much like his big sister Louise, <a href=#>Sam Thompson</a> has undergone some major physical changes since he first appeared on Made in Chelsea.</p><p>One of the most dramatic is his <a href=#>toned physique</a> - Sam, 30, now has a six pack and has piled on some muscles, thanks to spending more time in the gym.</p><p>His gnashers are also noticeably different. Before, there were gaps in his teeth, but now, they appear fuller and are sparkling white.</p><p>Sam has grown some facial hair too, which has given perhaps the best glow-up in the history of the show.</p><h2>Binky Felstead</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/binky-felstead.jpg><p>When we were first introduced to Binky Felstead, she was only 21 years old.</p><p>Some of the show's best moments centred around her <a href=#>romances</a> with <a href=#>Joshua Paterson</a> and <a href=#>Jamie Laing,</a> and her friendship with Ollie Locke.</p><p>Before she left in 2017, she was known for her heavy make-up and occasional big hair.</p><p>These days Binky, now 32 and <a href=#>married to Max Darnton</a>, can be seen sporting a more reserved fresh-faced look with her lush brunette locks worn in loose curls.</p><p>Binky also appears to have found the fountain of youth and has a wrinkle-free smile.</p><h2>Ollie Locke</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ollie-locke.jpg><p>Ollie Locke is currently the only OG cast member on the show and has given fans some of its most dramatic moments ever - who can forget his epic row with JP over his bestie Binky?</p><p>Ollie went under the knife to pin his ears back in July 2012 - pictures taken of him exiting a practice in Harley Street showed him with a bandage wrapped around his head.</p><p>At the time, Dr Yannick, who performed the surgery said: "Mr. Locke came to me a while ago with his concerns about his ears, and after a couple of consultations we decided to operate yesterday, ahead of his filming schedule for series 4 of Made In Chelsea, which I believe starts next week."</p><h2>Lucy Watson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lucy-watson.jpg><p>Although Lucy Watson, who went on to become one of the longest-serving female cast members, insists she hasn't had any work done, it hasn't stopped many from speculating that she's gone under the knife.</p><p>When she first started on Made in Chelsea, fans took to her natural look - these days, she appears to have plumper lips.</p><p>But in 2015, the star denied all the rumours and told OK!: "I think it's because I've changed my pose.</p><p>"I used to do a really fake smile but now I've started to pout and people have got a bit over-excited. If I had something done I'd be totally open about it."</p><h2>Rosie Fortescue</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/newspress-collage-21921201-1680535643240.jpg><p><a href=#>Rosie Fortescue</a> has been open about getting some work done.</p><p>The jewellery maker revealed last year that she tried composite bonding to give her teeth a more even look.</p><p>On Instagram, she gushed: "Ignore the state of me but beyond thrilled with my bonding. So natural but perfect at the same time. This isn’t an ad, I just love @drrhonaeskander’s work."</p><p>Although Rosie, 33, wasn't one of the more brash members of the cast, she still managed to find herself in explosive scenes, including her catfight with Phoebe Lettice Thompson.</p><p>She left the show after series 13 and has since excelled in the world of fashion.</p><h2>Tiffany Watson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tif-watson.jpg><p><a href=#>Tiffany Watson</a> burst on the Made in Chelsea scene as Sam Thompson's girlfriend but has since married Cameron McGheen with their first child on the way.</p><p>Known for her long blonde locks, Tiffany caused a stir in 2018 when her appearance at the National Television Awards left fans questioning whether she's had a <a href=#>boob job</a>.</p><p>To date, she has never confirmed or denied the rumours and enjoys posting raunchy lingerie snaps on social media.</p><p>Last year, she did admit to getting lip fillers in a TikTok post where she said: "@harleystinjectables are the only people I now trust with my lips. We did 0.4ml keeping it natural."</p><h2>Stephanie Pratt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/steph-pratt.jpg><p><a href=#>Stephanie Pratt</a> came over from the US to join Made in Chelsea back in 2013, where her turbulent romance with Spencer Matthews played out.</p><p>The former <a href=#>The Hills</a> star, 36, has been plagued with rumours of getting surgery since her time in <a href=#>Los Angeles</a>, which she has denied.</p><p>In 2015, when asked about a picture, she told OK!: "I didn't have anything done. That was literally just from going through a breakup. Unfortunately, that was just from crying."</p><p>It probably didn't help her cause when she boasted to her Chelsea co-stars that she could introduce them to the best cosmetic surgeons in LA when they filmed there that same year.</p><p>In recent years, Stephanie has been seen with fuller lips and a super slim jawline.</p><h2>Spencer Matthews</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/spencer-matthews.jpg><p>He was the show's original bad boy after and has gone on to achieve incredible success as an entrepreneur.</p><p>But Spencer Matthews has also undergone one of the most impressive body transformations, thanks to a gruelling exercise routine and <a href=#>lifestyle changes</a>.</p><p>The 34-year-old was certainly not chubby during the four years he spent on the show but in 2020, it was revealed that he had now dropped his <a href=#>body fat</a> to just 5 per cent.</p><p>He told Mens Health: "Alcohol played a big part in my teens and 20s." He added: "I realised I was never going to live up to my potential if I continued to allow alcohol to be a hurdle."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGphbn9yfo9qZqaZlJp6qrqMnJ%2BepKOarm6vwKyrrGWTna6vs8innmaekZiytHnTnpytoF2irqyxzq%2Bcq2WWnrmtsdFo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmade-in-chelsea-casts-changing-faces-teeth-makeover-filler.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmade-in-chelsea-casts-changing-faces-teeth-makeover-filler.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmade-in-chelsea-casts-changing-faces-teeth-makeover-filler.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmade-in-chelsea-casts-changing-faces-teeth-makeover-filler.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmade-in-chelsea-casts-changing-faces-teeth-makeover-filler.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmade-in-chelsea-casts-changing-faces-teeth-makeover-filler.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./my-600-lb-life-gina-krasley-dies.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./my-600-lb-life-gina-krasley-dies.html>My 600-Lb Life Star Dies At Age 30 Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jenna-ortega-discusses-her-work-choreographing-the-popular-wednesday-dance.html>Jenna Ortega Discusses Her Work Choreographing The Popular Wednesday Dance</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jenna-ortega-discusses-her-work-choreographing-the-popular-wednesday-dance.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
