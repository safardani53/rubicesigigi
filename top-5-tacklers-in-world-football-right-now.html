<time>01 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Defenders are frequently overlooked and underappreciated. A crucial interception or a crucial block does not receive the same amount of attention as a game-winning goal.</p><p>Certain actions, however, can catapult defenders into the spotlight. A well-executed tackle, for example, or a goal-line clearance. It is easier to assess the significance of these actions.</p><p>Tackling, in particular, is an art that not every player can master. It takes excellent timing and a lot of faith, because one small mistake can result in a penalty or a red card. We take a look at the top five tacklers in world football right now.</p><h2>Number 5: Fabinho</h2><p><strong>Fabinho,</strong> arguably the best defensive midfielder in the Premier League, has been a key component of Liverpool’s success under Jurgen Klopp.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fabinho.jpg><p>Many people were surprised when Liverpool announced the £40.5 million acquisition of Fabinho from AS Monaco in 2018. Although the Brazil international had performed admirably in France, few expected Liverpool to sign him. Fabinho arrived at Liverpool with a big reputation and, after a slow start, has flourished for the club.</p><p>Fabinho has made 134 appearances for the club in all competitions, winning the Premier League and the Champions League. Last season, the 28-year-old was frequently used as a center-back and impressed with his performances. Fabinho is a shrewd operator with excellent game reading and physical attributes.</p><h2>Number 4: Casemiro</h2><p><strong>Casemiro</strong>, the world’s best defensive midfielder, is the main reason Fabinho’s appearances for Brazil have been limited.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Casemiro-.jpg><p>He moved to Real Madrid from Sao Paulo in 2013 for £5.4 million, but he made his name during a loan spell with Porto. During the 2015-16 season, the Brazilian joined Real Madrid’s first team and has not looked back. He has made 301 appearances in all competitions for the club, scoring 30 goals and providing 25 assists.</p><p>The 29-year-old is a physical player who isn’t afraid to get his hands dirty. Luka Modric and Toni Kroos have arguably improved as a result of Casemiro’s presence. With Los Blancos, he has four Champions League titles and two La Liga titles.</p><h2>Number 3: Aaron Wan-Bissaka</h2><p><strong>Aaron Wan-Bissaka</strong> is not a full-fledged right-back. His attacking play leaves a lot to be desired, and he has been heavily chastised for his inability to contribute in the future.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Aaron-Wan-Bissaka.jpg><p>He is, however, one of the Premier League’s best one-on-one defenders. Wan-Bissaka joined Manchester United from Crystal Palace in 2019 for a fee of £49.5 million, having already established himself as an excellent tackler. His long legs undoubtedly aided him, and many of his tackles have been breathtaking to watch.</p><p>However, the 23-year-old remains an extremely limited right-back, with his defensive positioning under scrutiny. Wan-Bissaka has made 114 appearances for Manchester United in all competitions, scoring two goals and providing ten assists.</p><p>His play has improved slightly since the move, but much more is expected of a player who cost Manchester United nearly £50 million.</p><h2>Number 2: N’Golo Kante</h2><p><strong>N’Golo Kante</strong>, one of the best midfielders in the world, has been a revelation for Chelsea. Football fans all over the world adore the diminutive midfielder.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NGolo-Kante.jpg><p>During his time with Leicester City, Kante emerged as an exciting talent, helping the club win the Premier League in 2016. Chelsea did well to sign him for £32 million that year. The France international has established himself as a world-class midfielder for Chelsea.</p><p>Kante is known for his ball-winning ability and is full of energy and dynamism. For a brief moment, the 30-year-old was in contention to win the Ballon d’Or this time around. He was a key figure in Chelsea’s Champions League victory last season.</p><h2>Number 1: Wilfred Ndidi</h2><p><strong>Wilfred Ndidi</strong> has been linked with a move away from Leicester City in every transfer window, but nothing has come of it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Wilfred-Ndidi.jpg><p>Ndidi has been a standout performer for the Foxes. The Nigeria international is a top-tier defensive midfielder who combines physical prowess with strong defensive instincts. Ndidi joined Leicester City from Genk in 2017 for nearly £16 million, and his current club will almost certainly profit handsomely if he is sold.</p><p>Ndidi’s game continues to improve, with noticeable improvements in his ball-handling and passing ability in recent seasons. Potential suitors will notice, however, that he appears to be becoming more prone to knocks and injuries.</p><p>For some time now, the 24-year-old has been linked with a move away from Leicester City. Manchester United, Chelsea, and Manchester City have all been mentioned as possible landing spots.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKhdanq1rcKko56qo2K2r3nWqKmlnF2bvLDAwZqjpWWinrSpwIynprBn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftop-5-tacklers-in-world-football-right-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftop-5-tacklers-in-world-football-right-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftop-5-tacklers-in-world-football-right-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftop-5-tacklers-in-world-football-right-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftop-5-tacklers-in-world-football-right-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftop-5-tacklers-in-world-football-right-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-ezra-j-william-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-ezra-j-william-dating.html>Who is Ezra J William Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./s-p-b-charan.html>S.
