The pair wed in 1987, and soon after, he quit Magnum, P.I. so they could start a family together and live a quieter life on a ranch in Ventura, California.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm a fairly <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>private person</a>," the actor later told PEOPLE in 2020. "And I've always treasured the balance between work and time with my family. It's always about them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He eventually returned to acting, but his focus has always been on Mack and his children.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, who is Tom Selleck's wife?

The musical wasn't just an impressive milestone on Mack's résumé; it also brought her to Selleck.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1983, Selleck was in London filming Lassiter and spent his afternoons seeing Cats — an after-work activity his costar <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jane Seymour</a> found odd. "He kept telling me how great Cats was," Seymour told PEOPLE in 1984. "I thought it was good, but I couldn't see going back a dozen times."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mack's agent told PEOPLE, "They had dinner one night and it went on from there."

Only a handful of family members were present at the couple's secret wedding, including Selleck's brother, Bob, who arranged everything with fake names in hopes of throwing off the public and the media. Even the minister was left in the dark; they were expecting a "Tom Jenkins" and a "Suzie Mark."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A local Nevada paper ran a story about the celebrity couple's nuptials a month later, alerting the world of their private ceremony.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They were both nervous, like any other couple about to get married," the chapel's pastor recalled of Selleck and Mack's big day. "He was very concerned that the service be heartfelt, very concerned for her that the service be meaningful. He is a very warm, caring man."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to his marriage with Mack, Selleck was married to actress Jacqueline Ray for 11 years; the pair finalized their divorce in 1982.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-their-daughter-is-a-professional-equestrian></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Their daughter is a professional equestrian</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple welcomed daughter Hannah Margaret Selleck on Dec. 16, 1988. Hannah spent most of her childhood on their family ranch, where she learned how to take care of horses. "We both thought it was the best environment for her to grow up," Mack told PEOPLE in 2012. Selleck added that their country lifestyle had a positive influence on Hannah's maturity as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A decorated equestrian, Hannah began riding competitively at the age of 10. She has professionally competed in both the hunter and jumper rings at the international level. In 2012, she founded <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Descanso Farm</a>, which focuses on "the development of top-quality sales horses and the advancement of horses' show careers."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Selleck also has a son, Kevin, whom he adopted with his first wife.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-her-and-sellecks-happy-place-is-their-family-ranch></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Her and Selleck's happy place is their family ranch</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Sonia Moskowitz/IMAGES/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following Hannah's birth, the couple stepped out of the spotlight to focus on their family, moving to a secluded ranch in Ventura, California. The 65-acre property has a horse corral and was once a working avocado farm, which Selleck tended to himself until the California droughts decimated the trees.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My relationships and my ranch keep me sane," the Friends star told PEOPLE in 2020. "I do grunt work and I make the rounds. I like watching things grow. It's a retreat."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the couple's 2012 interview with PEOPLE, Selleck referred to the family ranch as "a real blessing," adding that it had helped him find a "balance" between his work and personal life. But Selleck wouldn't be found eating the fruits of his labor. "I don't eat 'em," the actor said of his homegrown avocados. "Honestly, they make me gag. But it's just as well. I'll sell my portion."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-made-frequent-cameos-on-magnum-pi></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She made frequent cameos on Magnum, P.I</strong>.</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Alexander Tamargo/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her career in the U.K. may have ended, but Mack has made several TV appearances across the pond. In fact, she made several cameos on Selleck's hit show, Magnum, P.I., in both seasons 4 and 5. Mack also appeared in an episode of both the '90s sitcom Frasier and the medical drama ER.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-their-top-priorities-are-privacy-and-family></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Their top priorities are privacy and family</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>SGranitz/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even before Selleck and Mack settled down together, the Blue Bloods actor set boundaries between his public and personal life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've found it very difficult to expose my private life and live with it," Selleck told PEOPLE in 1984. At the time, he and Mack were living in Hawaii, where he was filming Magnum, P.I. "There are certain things I'm just not comfortable with," he added on sharing too much of his personal life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking to PEOPLE in 2012, Selleck said that quitting Magnum, P.I. to focus on his family was one of the best decisions he had ever made. Back then, the actor regularly worked 90-hour weeks and spent his breaks filming movies. "It took a long time to get off the train," he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Selleck continued, "My first priority is time with my family," adding it had been imperative to "nurture" his marriage with Mack. "I think wanting time away from work has been good for that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6SrfLi0zmagrGWanrmttcRmpJqbm2LBsLmMrJylpJWYuG7DyJ%2BcaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-jillie-mack-tom-selleck-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-jillie-mack-tom-selleck-wife.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-jillie-mack-tom-selleck-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-jillie-mack-tom-selleck-wife.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-jillie-mack-tom-selleck-wife.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-jillie-mack-tom-selleck-wife.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./yannick-bisson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./yannick-bisson.html>Yannick Bisson</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./scott-pattersons-girlfriend-list.html>Scott Pattersons Girlfriend: Who is Scott Patterson Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./scott-pattersons-girlfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
