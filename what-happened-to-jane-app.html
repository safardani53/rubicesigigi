Jane, which operated at both Jane.com and as an app, was sort of like a marketplace. Many want to know what happened to the company following its sudden closure.</p><p>While there's still plenty of information that we don't know yet about what happened to Jane, we do know there was an ongoing investigation into the company. Here's what else we know about Jane following the news that it's now closed.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to the Jane app?</h2><p>Jane and its app are no longer working because the company has closed, leaving both users and sellers confused. According to reporting from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KSL TV</a>, the Lehi Police Department opened an investigation into Jane, but didn't offer much detail on what that investigation is focused on. At its height, the woman-focused platform featured more than 2,000 sellers, but following the news that it closed, many of those sellers are without money that they say the company owes them.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Laura Mederos had been selling with the company for almost a decade. She said that when the company shut down, it still owed her money. She said that her niece, another seller with the site, was also owed money when the news of the company's closure broke.</p><p>The station reported that a former employee claims employees were let go on Nov. 17, 2023, without severance or healthcare.</p><p>In many cases, sellers who were working through Jane say that the company closed while still owing then tens of thousands of dollars.</p><p>“It’s been very disappointing as a small business owner. It’s going to devastate families," Jane Abegg, a jeweler who sells through Jane, told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Salt Lake Tribune</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>As recently as 2022, Jane was heralded as an enormous success story. The company had also named a new CEO. Now, it's unclear who is in charge of the company or what exactly happened that led to the sudden collapse. While those details may be uncertain right now, there are plenty of sellers and shoppers who are furious over the news.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What should you do if you ordered something from Jane?</h2><p>If you ordered something from Jane recently, you'll likely want to contact with your credit card company to dispute the charges related to the site. You'll need to explain that the business shuttered suddenly, and see if there's anything they can do. Policies vary by company, so it may or may not be possible for you to retrieve some of the money that you spent on the product.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSjmZ6aeqK8zw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-jane-app.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-jane-app.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-jane-app.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-jane-app.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-jane-app.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-jane-app.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./brittanya-razavi.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./brittanya-razavi.html>Brittanya Razavi</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./park-bo-youngs-boyfriend-list.html>Park Bo-youngs Boyfriend: Who is Park Bo-young Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./park-bo-youngs-boyfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
